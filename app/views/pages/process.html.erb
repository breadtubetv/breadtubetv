This project aims to list content creators that fit into the [r/BreadTube](/reddit) culture of anti-capitalist media seeking to educate people in an entertaining and informative manner.

We do not intend to be auditors of what does-and-doesn't quantify as BreadTube content, this topic itself is a point of contention across the Internet and only serves to gate-keep smaller creators getting started.

### Website

Currently due to technical limitations and with a very small technical development team we have not automated channel addition on the website. However this is the eventual goal, to track the subreddit and add new channels as they come.

However content is automatically retrieved from YouTube for any channel which has been added to the site, which means that every hour you'll find [new videos](/videos) have been imported.

If you believe a channel is missing please contact [@dirkkellycom](/dirkkellycom) who will be happy to get you added to the site, provided you've been well received on [r/breadtube](/reddit) or your content fits within the broader community.

### PeerTube

We provide [watch.breadtube.tv](/peertube) as a service for any BreadTube relevant content creator to host their work on an alternative service to YouTube.

PeerTube works better the more people use it because viewers of PeerTube videos are also streamers of the content to other viewers. Our instance is also federated which means that following instances receive notifications of the videos uploaded to the tool.

We have moderators who actively review new users and uploads to ensure that the work matches the ethos of the broader community. You can reach out for more information about PeerTube in our [Developer Discord](/discord/developers/). If you feel like any of our moderation practices were misguided please let us know.

Our website can also show links to PeerTube channels and videos, configuring these links is currently a manual process, though we are working on automating this also. In the future we can imagine a service for content creators that provides automated backups and redistribution for the videos they upload on their YouTube channel, though details of this are still to be determined.

### Notifications

New video and channel additions are sporadically notified on [@dirkkellycom](/dirkkellycom), however technical integration with the various social media channels would allow us to automate this process and get the word out more effectively.

Due to the decentralized nature of the BreadTube project overall this process is in its early stages, if you are an administrator or moderator of the social channels we'd love to talk to you more about this.
