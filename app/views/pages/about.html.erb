### Introduction

[BreadTube.tv](https://breadtube.tv) is the collaborative effort of Creators, Subscribers, Moderators, Developers, Designers, and Coordinators working together to list content that is posted on [r/BreadTube](/reddit/) and related mediums.

BreadTube is a reference to the left-wing anarchist Peter Kropotkin's 1982 book - ["The Conquest of Bread"](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/petr-kropotkin-the-conquest-of-bread).

The goal of the community is to challenge the far-right content creators who have taken advantage of the profit-driven algorithms used by services like YouTube for the purpose of spreading hate. 

We wish educate people on how their world operates, the alternative possible visions for our future, and how we organize ourselves to get there.

This website is a resource for discovering and sharing BreadTube content, channels are sourced from [r/BreadTube](/reddit/) posts and videos are synced from YouTube.

Services such as YouTube use hidden algorithms to serve content to users, the preferences of these algorithms are determined by YouTube's values, which as they are a subsidiary of Google is the generation of capital through Advertising.

Replacing a service like YouTube is unfeasible for any community, let alone one as small as ours, however utilizing its features and circumnavigating the algorithm using our own listings is possible.

With [BreadTube.tv](/) we get the benefit of having a low cost and [open source](/gitlab/) tool to do that.

### Development

There are currently two core projects being actively developed and would really benefit from **your** help!

### Projects

#### [BreadTube.tv](/gitlab/breadtubetv/)

The website you are currently looking at is built with [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org), a web development framework which is aimed at being both simple and fun to work with.

The website exists to create a [searchable](/videos/), [extendable](/videos.json), and automated hub for referencing the communities content in order to make it more resilient to capitalist censorship and more discoverable through online indexing.

This site isn't meant to replace the likes of YouTube, instead it is meant to provide links to all the places where creators distribute their content and need your support.

There is a lot of potential for this tool to provide genuinely useful services for content creators, one of the first goals we have is to provide an automated mirroring service from YouTube to PeerTube.

#### [PeerTube](/gitlab/peertube/)

We know that creators are stuck using YouTube while it is a source of audience members, we also know that this leaves them at the mercy of the corporatist algorithms which serve to silence a lot of their messages in order to retain capitalist hegemony.

Building audiences on other platforms is a time consuming and potentially fruitless exercise, if you can't reach a critical mass on a platform then the time you spent there would have been better served somewhere else.

That being said there are many creators who have been longing for a PeerTube instance which promotes our communities values and provides them with a place to mirror their YouTube content and expand their distribution.

This tool is available for anyone within the community to use, we welcome your uploads and would appreciate your feedback about how to moderate and administrate the service.

There is further potential for this tool in the form of automation, combined with the website project we have a vision of automatically mirroring content of creators who opt into the service, providing them with an lower effort entrance into expanding their audience and increasing their content resilience. 

## Values

Our values as a development team are those of any other self organizing community focussed on the conquest of bread through the emancipation of humanity from the enslavement of capital.

In this regard the means are content distribution systems which are focussed on educating people about the history, struggle, and potential futures of our species in regards to the philosophies, politics, and economics which define our lives.

As a development team our utility and existence to the movement is dependent on us being informed, understanding, and empathetic of the needs of the community and to respond by developing them the things that can make them flourish.

We do not consider ourselves to be the single instance of this mission, our collaboration is entirely voluntary and non binding, what we learn and achieve together on the projects we embark on will serve ourselves and further causes throughout time in unknowing ways.

## Feedback

The easiest way to talk to everyone involved is on the [Developer Discord](/discord/developers/)

You can also [open a new issue](/gitlab/issues/) to suggest a change.
