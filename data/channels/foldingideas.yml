    description: "I'm writing this description after the channel has seen a sudden
      surge in popularity. I'm also medicated and in a fighting mood. I just finished
      ranting on Twitter about the efforts in Canada to de-socialize our medicine
      and kill poor people. This is the YouTube channel where I talk about narrative
      theory: the mechanisms of storytelling. This encompasses the wider communications
      theories about the way that we process information, the techniques of how those
      messages are delivered, and the conglomerate application of all of the above.\n\nThe
      main subject is popular culture because it's easier to dissect and its messages
      are less likely to go interrogated because we're trained to view it as innocuous.
      \"Just a movie\" or \"just a game.\"\n\nFascism is a loser ideology.\n\n\U0001F33D"
