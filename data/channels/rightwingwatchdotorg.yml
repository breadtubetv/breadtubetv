description: People For the American Way's Right Wing Watch is dedicated to monitoring
  and reporting on the activities of right-wing political organizations, in order
  to expose the agenda of the extreme Right. We hope that by shedding light on the
  activities of right-wing organizations, we can expose the risks that their extreme
  and intolerant agendas present to our country.
