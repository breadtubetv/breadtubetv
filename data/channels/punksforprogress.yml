description: 5 Punk Rock Anticapitalists covering the world's events from a Socialist
  perspective. We would like this Marxist Media collective to grow, so we are WAY
  open to submissions and hearing from anyone interested in covering the goings on
  in their own regions, and that means anywhere in the world! So, are you Antifascist?
  Are you at the very least Socialism curious?

    description: Punks For Progress is a project started by a coupl'a ol' Punk Rockers,
      a nephew and uncle - Reverend Aaron and Punker Mike, respectively. We then added
      So-Cal Shannon, then Radd Kahn from the Bay Area, then Bobby Oh from the Bronx.
      5 Punk Rock Anticapitalists covering the world's events from a Socialist perspective.
      We would like this Marxist Media collective to grow, so we are WAY open to submissions
      and hearing from anyone interested in covering the goings on in their own regions,
      and that means anywhere in the world! So, are you Antifascist? Are you at the
      very least Socialism curious? (don't necessarily HAVE to be a Punk Rocker, but
      it helps), are you willing to do your own homework? Hit us up! We started as
      (and pretty much still are) two idiots trying to figure out how to cover a Capitalist
      world where the farthest Left media is ultimately barely Progressive. So, we
      don't expect anyone else to be "real journalists", we just wanna bolster honest
      oppressed and minority voices!
