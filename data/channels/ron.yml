      \n\nBeing an activist, I talk about activism-y stuff. If you want a different,
      interesting perspective, hey, maybe you'll find it here. \n\nGoal? Well, the
      goal of any kind of activism is to engage people. I'm gonna crawl out of the
      hole I live in, go out into the Youtubes, find folk from all walks of life with
      all different kinds of ideologies, and see if I can maybe challenge their way
      of thinking. Or at least find some common ground I and they can work on together.\n\nI'm
      still figuring out how to do basic Youtube stuff. Like download other people's
      videos. Or how to make good edit like smart person. But I'll get there eventually;
      until then, I'm hoping to coast on my unusual insights and morbid sense of humor.
      \n\nAlso, people tell me I'm funny. Sometimes. I keep telling them to stop encouraging
      me, but they won't listen."
