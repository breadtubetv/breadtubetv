      If we let the world’s temperature rise by a little over 2 degrees Celsius, the results will be catastrophic - sea levels will rise to untenable levels, heat waves will become far more common, freshwater will become even more scarce, and many more effects besides.

      The time to act is now, before it’s too late. As a society, we need to change our course.

      For this reason, the Earth Strike movement has formed a plan of action spanning 2019 with four primary international events.
