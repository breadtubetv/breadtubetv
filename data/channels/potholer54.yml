    description: "The main purpose of this channel is to explain in simple terms the
      conclusions of scientific research, and correct some of the unsourced crap we
      get fed on the Internet. I am a former science journalist (see the \"Who I am\"
      video) with a degree in geology.\n\nFeel free to post. The only rules are :\n\nDON'T...\n1)
      ...plagiarize (or copy-and-paste long text from other sites.) \n2) ...post racist
      abuse\n3) ...advertise (including posting links that aren't citations.)\n4)
      ...disable the 'replies' function\n5) ...disrupt discussions by editing posts
      after they've been commented on, \n5) ...spam and troll -- e.g. repeat posts,
      or post multiple times simply to fill up the forum and drown out other posts.
      The purpose of the fora is to promote discussion, not have people disrupt it.
      So...\n\nDO\n...instigate discussion, debate, criticize, point out errors so
      that I can correct them (with a time and a verbatim quote)"
