description: Wisecrack is a collective of comedians, academics, filmmakers, and artists
  who are super curious about the world around us. Our channel explores big ideas
  in unusual (and hopefully super entertaining) ways. We dive into philosophy and
  critical thinking through the lens of movies, TV shows, video games, and books.
