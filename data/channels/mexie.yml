description: PhD graduate from Toronto. I studied Human Geography / Political Ecology,
  focusing on the intersections between political economy and global environmental governance.
  This sobering experience has led me to be the staunch anti-capitalist, vegan activist you see today!
  I make educational videos about political economy/capitalism, environmental issues,
  veganism, and issues relating to social/economic justice
