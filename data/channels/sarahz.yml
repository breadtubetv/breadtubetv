  Video essays critiquing popular media (I like to focus on television and adaptations, 
  but I also like to critique film and literature sometimes!). 
  I try to focus on media through both a critical lens, talking about media as it pertains 
  to larger society, and an analytical lens, providing substantive analysis on the work itself.
