description: We are recording anarchist and related texts and distributing them in
  audio form. In this way we hope to make anarchist ideas more accessible, and anarchist
  practice more informed. We may not agree with every word of every text we record,
  but we hope that the distribution of these texts in audio form continues lively
  anarchist discussions — and ultimately we hope that those discussions lead us into
  the streets.
