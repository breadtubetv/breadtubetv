    description: "We're focused on making quality analysis mostly of anime with a
      leftist perspective. We particularly care about shonen, and feel like we have
      a FRESH!~ perspective. Star is the only member who hasn't watched the masterpiece
      that is Hunter x Hunter 2011, so I'll just leave a reminder for him here to
      do that. \n\nOur Ronin Collective:\nCalliope The Cantaloupe\nCherryBoyWriter\nStar\nTheHunterxHunter2011DickingRidingAssociation"
