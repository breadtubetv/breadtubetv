      Hello! I'm Cameron. I'm a hetero, white, cisgender man with Asperger's, and I'm an anarchist. To find out what that means, check out my playlist 'Anarchism in Four Parts'.
      https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLw7ewOoq0Z4vnCOsKoOIPdLQyKRVsdVgY
      The transcript for those videos can be found here:

      Anyone who wants to translate my videos into other languages is free to do so.

      A lot of people ask me what books I can recommend about anarchism. I suggest checking out the following:
      The Anarchist FAQ (Online resource)
      Peter Kropotkin - The Conquest of Bread
      Iain McKay - Direct Struggle Against Capital: A Peter Kropotkin Anthology
      Frank Mintz - Anarchism and Workers' Self-management in Revolutionary Spain
      Peter Gelderloos - Anarchy Works
