  Anti-Union Propaganda is a compilation of anti-union propaganda training videos shown to workers, or "associates," by the capitalist class. Corporations like Walmart, Amazon and Target go to cringey lengths to discourage union membership. The video was made by Art House Politics, a channel on Left Tube (an online community of creators such as Contrapoints, hbomberguy and Shaun). It is styled in a kind of vaporwave style to capture the retro aesthetic and hypnotic influence to combat labor organization.
