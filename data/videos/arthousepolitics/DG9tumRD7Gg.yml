  Ben Shapiro, Cultural Critic is a cartoon animation made by Art House Politics, a creator on Left Tube - a video & meme space led by Contrapoints, hbomberguy and Shaun. In real clips from the Ben Shapiro Show, the AOC fan DESTROYS John Lennon's Imagine in the most cringey way. He then OBLITERATES the grammar of Future's rap song. Okay, this is epic.
