  Review / film criticism of the surreal sci-fi movie Sorry To Bother You, directed by Boots Riley & starring Tessa Thompson & Lakeith Stanfield. A fail or "sin" for everything wrong with Sorry To Bother You in 6 minutes or less. (Numerals in titles increase engagement.) Cinema Fails is a Youtube empire not unlike WatchMojo, CinemaSins, video essayists or LeftTube titans like Contrapoints or Shaun. No association with Art House Politics. This video is satire therefore immune to criticism. Buy our T Shirts
