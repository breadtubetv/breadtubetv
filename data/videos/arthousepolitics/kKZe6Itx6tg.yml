  A grade school play about America goes horribly wrong.


  ...


  This Jack Stauber-inspired cartoon animation was made by Art House Politics, a channel on Left Tube (an online community of creators such as Contrapoints, hbomberguy and Shaun). A school play about the United States of America and its civic cult elements - the pledge of allegiance, flag, national anthem, etc. - becomes empty pageantry for nationalism and imperialism. Window dressing that forms the social relation to the nation is expressed in service of Trump, centrism, Cold-War anti-socialist paranoia. The cringey video is styled with a nostalgic home video VHS scan line effect. USA
