  Anthropology Animals is a cute cartoon animation about the human condition, adding to an earlier video "The Moment Astrology Was Invented." It was made by Art House Politics, a creator on Left Tube - a video & meme space led by Contrapoints, hbomberguy and Shaun. The chill racoon and the cute, easily awed bird are good friends in a relaxing video set to Kirby music. It covers topics such as spirituality, astrology, mathematics, gender, language, and art.
