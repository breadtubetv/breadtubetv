description: "[CW: graphic/sexual assault] Rep. Ilhan Omar questioning war criminal

  with the genocide and crimes against humanity he oversaw in Guatemala, El Salvador
  and Nicaragua to his lizard face. \n\nSupport us on Patreon: http://patreon.com/ArtHousePolitics\nTwitter:

  Abrams is special envoy to Venezuela, instead of special envoy to a jail cell. John
  Bolton admits on Fox that the Venezuelan coup is about oil.\n\n#StandWithIlhan Ilhan
  Omar is one of the first Muslim women in Congress along with Rashida Tlaib, and
  she came in swinging against the foreign policy consensus and corrosive corruption
  in DC. The right wing coordinated a media attack calling her antisemitic when she
  criticized AIPAC for influencing Israel policy. Liberals played their part, Pelosi
  and Schumer issued a condemnation and the GOP is now calling for her to resign."
