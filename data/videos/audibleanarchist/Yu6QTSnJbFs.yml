  In this excerpt from the book "Dirty Truths," first published in 1996, political scientist and theorist Michael Parenti examines what he calls the "normality" of fascism. Most people, especially white, affluent or middle-class Americans would either not notice the presence of fascism or would actually embrace it. Many Americans are already primed for fascist politics in their demonization of scapegoats, their support for the police state, and their desired repression of political dissidents. Parenti also presciently predicted the rise of a figure like Donald Trump, who mobilizes popular sentiment against vulnerable populations (immigrants, Muslims, the poor, "criminals") in order to consolidate power within the state, using the democratic support of middle Americans to strip away civil rights and protections from others.
