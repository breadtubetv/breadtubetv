  Howard Zinn (1922-2010) was an American historian, anarchist, and activist. He authored 20 books, including "A People's History of the United States," one of the most influential and controversial books of the twentieth century. Zinn had the audacity to write about historically marginalized peoples, and he took great pains to write about history from their perspectives. In this essay, excerpted from the book "A Power Governments Cannot Suppress," Zinn explores how the political elites of the US ignore and silence discussions of class, thereby denying how all of American history is littered with class struggle. Zinn concludes the essay by calling for large and unified social movements of the working and exploited classes to overthrow the ruling class that controls the US government.
