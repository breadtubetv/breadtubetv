  a word, commercial competition, under the paternal aegis of the law, allows the
  great majority of merchants-— and this fact is attested to in countless medical
  inquests-— adulterate provisions and drink, sell pernicious substances as wholesome
  food, and kill by slow poisoning… Let people say what they will, slavery, which
  abolitionists strove so gallantly to extirpate in America, prevails in another form
  in every civilized country; for entire populations, placed between the alternatives
  of death by starvation and toils which they detest, are constrained to choose the
  latter. And if we would deal frankly with the barbarous society to which we belong,
  we must acknowledge that murder, albeit disguised under a thousand insidious and
  scientific forms, still, as in the times of primitive savagery, terminates the majority
  of lives.” \n― Élisée Reclus"
