  Rudolf Rocker (1873-1958) was an anarchist writer, historian, and activist. He wrote extensively on anarchist movements and thinkers. He is perhaps best known for his book "Nationalism and Culture," which criticizes nationalism, religion, and the state.

  In this chapter, Rocker examines proto-syndicalist movements in England and France, as well as the first years of the International.
