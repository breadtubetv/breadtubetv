title: No Wall They Can Build Part 9  - The North
description: "The audiobook version of CrimeThinc's No Wall They Can Build, a book
  about immigration and border violence. \n\nText of the book http://www.infoshop.org/no-wall-they-can-build/\nThe
  Ex worker podcast https://crimethinc.com/podcasts/no-wall-they-can-build/episodes/9\n\nWelcome
  to Episode 9 of No Wall They Can Build, the Ex-Worker Podcast’s serialized audiobook
  exploring borders and migration across North America. The border doesn’t end at
  the border: the violent regime of citizenship constrains and ruins lives throughout
  the north, as a chilling story of a narrow escape from death makes clear. Yet this
  ongoing migration constitutes, against all odds, a powerful form of resistance that
  is changing the United States in unpredictable ways. This installment begins to
  explore what it might take to actually end death in the desert—which would also
  mean dismantling the global systems of exploitation, colonialism, white supremacy,
  and state power that lie at its roots. We can take inspiration and strategic guidance
  from some of the stories that appear in this episode, ranging from an extraordinary
  migrant whose ingenuity and determination helped him to survive multiple crossings
  against unthinkable odds to a team of civil disobedience activists whose simple
  action managed to briefly grind part of the migrant detention industrial complex
  to a halt. Listening won’t offer a single path, program, or tactic that’s guaranteed
  to work, but rather a way of thinking about resistance at multiple points of intervention
  that can start wherever you are. Whatever action you take, it’s time to take sides."
