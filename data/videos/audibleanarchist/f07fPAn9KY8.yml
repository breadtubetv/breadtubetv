description: "Full text here: https://libcom.org/library/enemy-system-sends-us-war-speech-iraq-war-veteran\n\n\"Our
  real enemy is not the ones living in a distant land whose names or policies we don’t
  understand; The real enemy is a system that wages war when it’s profitable, the
  CEOs who lay us off our jobs when it’s profitable, the Insurance Companies who deny
  us Health care when it’s profitable, the Banks who take away our homes when it’s
  profitable. Our enemies are not several hundred thousands away. They are right here
  in front of us.\" \n- Mike Prysner"
