title: Anarchist FAQ Section A What is Anarchism 2 17
description: "Full text http://anarchism.pageabode.com/afaq/pdf.html\n\n\"An Anarchist
  FAQ\" is a FAQ written by an international work group of social anarchists connected
  through the internet. It documents anarchist theory and ideas and argues in favor
  of social anarchism. It also explores other debates internal to the anarchist movement
  and counters common arguments against anarchism. It has been in constant evolution
  since 1995. While it was started as a critique of anarcho-capitalism, by the time
  it was officially released it had become a general introduction to anarchism. \n\nThe
  FAQ is published under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License (copyleft)
  and it is dedicated \"to the millions of anarchists, living and dead, who tried
  and are trying to create a better world\". It was officially released online on
  19 July 1996 \"to celebrate the Spanish Revolution of 1936 and the heroism of the
  Spanish anarchist movement\"."
