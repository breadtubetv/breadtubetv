  https://crimethinc.com/podcast\n\nWelcome to Episode 4 of No Wall They Can Build,
  the Ex-Worker Podcast’s serialized audiobook exploring borders and migration across
  North America. This week’s installment continues the previous episode’s exploration
  of the conditions south of the border that drive migration north by surveying the
  situation in the three countries of the “Northern Triangle.” Guatemala’s malnourished,
  heavily indigenous population languishes in poverty under oligarchic rule, the legacy
  of centuries of colonialism and a devastating civil war. Our narrator analyzes the
  numerous problems plaguing the country and examines the unfinished struggle for
  freedom and dignity that prompted the war, including its impact on global revolutionary
  imagination through its influence on the Zapatistas. The horrifying levels of violence
  in El Salvador trace their roots both to economic pressures and to US support for
  the former reactionary military regime during a bloody civil war. The section concludes
  with a hair-raising anecdote about the guerrilla movement’s creative revenge against
  a genocidal army officer. A brief note on the profound dysfunction of Honduras,
  stemming from the structure of North American economy, is followed by a discussion
  of the tensions between these four Central American nations and their inhabitants.
  This episode rounds out our picture of the recent history of the region and the
  dynamics that push people from their homelands on the perilous trip towards the
  US/Mexico border."
