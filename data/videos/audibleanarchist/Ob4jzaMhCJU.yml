  This video is dedicated to Heather Heyer, an antifascist activist whose life was cut short by a neo-Nazi in Charlottesville, Virginia on August 12, 2017. This video is also dedicated to all the people who have ever been killed or injured in the struggle against fascism. We stand with you in solidarity. Rest in power, comrades.

  A gofundme has been set up for medical expenses for those who were injured. https://www.gofundme.com/medical-fund-for-comrades-in-cville
