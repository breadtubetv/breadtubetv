title: Part 2 of "Ideas on Social Organization" by James Guillaume
description: "Full text available here: https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/james-guillaume-ideas-on-social-organization\n\nNotes
  on Ideas on Social Organization\nby The Anarchist Spectacle :\n\nThese notes are
  meant to be read after reading Ideas on Social Organization by James Guillaume.
  They add a 21st century refinement to his ideas for a future society. \n\n\n1. By
  corporation, Guillaume means the equivilent to an industrial union. The word had
  a different meaning at the time than it does today.\n2. By exchange, Guillaume means
  the transfer of goods from one actor to another. By buying, Guillaume means the
  subtraction of a worker's labour vouchers for the good that the worker wants.\n3.
  By selling, Guillaume means the swapping of the producers goods or the giving of
  a service by the service provider in exchange for labour vouchers.\n4. Guillaume
  says that the system of labour vouchers will gradually transition into a system
  where goods are given purely on the basis of need or desire. This transition will
  happen as the good is no longer in need of any form of rationioning.\n5. The purpose
  of the labour vouchers is not to maintain renumeration or a currency system, but
  instead as a rationing mechanism for goods that are not abundant enough to be given
  out without regulation.\n6. In the context of the 21st century, the Communal Statistical
  Commission would simply be a computer program that connects to the different producer's
  collectives via the internet. It. would likely simply called the Communal Statistics
  Program. In the time of Guillaume, the lack of information age technology necessitated
  a human composed commision. \n7. In a similar fashion to the Communal Statistical
  Commision, the Bank of Exchange would have a drastically simplified mechanism in
  the 21st century. There would be no need to send delegates to convey estimated levels
  of economic demand. Workers at their various workplaces could simply use computers
  that are connected to the internet to convey their production levels. People in
  their homes would simply fill out a form on a computer on a regular basis to indicate
  their estimated consumption levels.\n8. Labour vouchers would certainly not be paper
  or physical in todays world. Instead we could store the worker's vouchers in a large
  distributed computer database that is connected via the internet. This way, we could
  leverage the technology that used by debit cards and simply have a worker swipe
  a card whenever they obtain a good or service. \n9. Once the scarcity of goods becomes
  low due to the advances in production from collectivization, the communes could
  simply have a combined voucher pool that each worker subtracts from when they take
  something.  It would make sense to retain labour vouchers in this limited way, because
  of the enhancement of precision it would create for economic planning. The vouchers
  would evolve from being a rationing mechanism into a purely statistical device for
  economic planning.\n10. In the section on security, Guillaume talks about how there
  would be a \"Communal Police\" so to speak. He admits in the same sentence that
  the word has a bad connotation, but it seems likely he merely could not think of
  an alternative phrase. A better term would be the \"Communal Safety Committee\".
  As Guillaume states, all physically able people in the commune would participate
  in this Communal Safety Committee. It seems obvious to me that violent crimes would
  not be punished, but rather the perpetrator of the act would rehabilitated. Guillaume
  indicates this intention in the last sentence of the security section. \"Criminals
  being an exception, they will be treated like the sick and the deranged; the problem
  of crime which today gives so many jobs to judges, jailers, and police will lose
  its social importance and become simply a chapter in medical history.\"\n11. Guillame
  uses exlusively masculine pronouns, but this is not due to a sexist attitude, but
  rather due to language and writing conventions of the 1870s. It should be noted
  that the usage of the masculine pronoun as gender neutral among anarchists was the
  norm until language began to be analyzed further by the anarchist movement in the
  20th century. The same can be said of the terms \"men\" and \"man\", which refer
  accordingly to the terms \"people\", and \"person\"."
