  Rudolf Rocker (1873-1958) was an anarchist writer, historian, and activist. He wrote extensively on anarchist movements and thinkers. He is perhaps best known for his book "Nationalism and Culture," which criticizes nationalism, religion, and the state.

  In this chapter, Rocker introduces various schools of anarchism and compares them to liberalism, democracy, and authoritarian communism. He also outlines anarchism's critique of capitalism and the state.
