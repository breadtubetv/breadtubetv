title: No Wall They Can Build Part 10 - From East to West, Chaos and Order, and Transformation
description: "The audiobook version of CrimeThinc's No Wall They Can Build, a book
  about immigration and border violence. \n\nText of the book http://www.infoshop.org/no-wall-they-can-build/\nThe
  Ex worker podcast https://crimethinc.com/podcasts\n\n\nWelcome to Episode 10 of
  No Wall They Can Build, the Ex-Worker Podcast’s serialized audiobook exploring borders
  and migration across North America. Over the past two months, we’ve explored the
  ins and outs of irregular migration across the US/Mexico border. Where does it leave
  us? As the crises produced by climate change and economic exploitations intensify
  across the world, revolutions turn in to wars, which beget tyranny, which in turn
  provoke revolutions. In this climate of escalating chaos, what can we do? This episode
  explores the meaning of revolution in the twenty-first century, looking at the forms
  it has taken and assessing what it would take to defend it today. The Zapatista
  struggle offers one of the most durable and promising models of autonomy we’ve seen
  in recent decades—yet the limits it has encountered point towards unavoidable contradictions
  facing those who wish to avoid warfare and bloodshed but also cannot defend their
  achievements against remorseless foes without the force of arms. A harrowing story
  about the siege of San Juan Copala, an indigenous community whose effort to secure
  autonomy from the Mexican state was brutally crushed, illustrates the agonizing
  dilemma that faces would-be revolutionaries today. This episode offers an unflinching
  look at the perils confronting those who would defy these global systems driving
  displacement and death, setting the stage for our final installment next week on
  solidarity and coming home.\n\nTable of Contents:\n\n    Introduction {0:01}\n    From
