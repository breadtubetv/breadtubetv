  Rudolf Rocker (1873-1958) was an anarchist writer, historian, and activist. He wrote extensively on anarchist movements and thinkers. He is perhaps best known for his book "Nationalism and Culture," which criticizes nationalism, religion, and the state.

  In this chapter, Rocker documents early proto-anarchist and socialist movements that emerged in the early- and mid-nineteenth century. He examines the Luddites, the Chartists, trade unionism, and early socialism in England.
