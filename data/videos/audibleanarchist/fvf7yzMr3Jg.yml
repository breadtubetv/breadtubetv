  Bakunin's most famous work, published in various lengths, this version is the most complete form of the work published hitherto.

  Originally titled "Dieu et l'Ã©tat", Bakunin intended it to be part of the second portion to a larger work named "The Knouto-Germanic Empire and the Social Revolution" (Knouto-Germanic Empire is in reference to a treaty betwixt Russia and Germany at the time), but the work was never completed.
