  Full text of the original interview published in 2008: https://www.counterpunch.org/2008/05/12/rebels-against-tyranny/

  Howard Zinn (1922-2010) was an American historian, anarchist, and activist. He authored 20 books, including "A People's History of the United States," one of the most influential and controversial books of the twentieth century. Zinn had the audacity to write about historically marginalized peoples, and he took great pains to write about history from their perspectives. In this interview, Zinn explores the histories of some of the anarchist and anarchist-inspired groups in the US, as well as the state of anarchism both in America and internationally.
