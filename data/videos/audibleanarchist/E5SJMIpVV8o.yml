  Emma Goldman (1869-1940) was an anarchist political theorist, activist, and writer. Her work influenced numerous political and social movements in the US and Europe, especially for anarchism, feminism, atheism, anti-imperialism, anti-militarism, and anti-capitalism. She was imprisoned several times for distributing information about contraception, for her opposition to the First World War and conscription, and for the attempted assassination of industrialist Henry Clay Frick. In response to her dissident activism, the American government deported Goldman to Russia. She is perhaps best remembered for being a champion of women's liberation and for making tremendous strides in feminism while many bourgeois white feminists were solely concerned with suffrage.
