description: "The audiobook version of CrimeThinc's No Wall They Can Build, a book
  about immigration and border violence. \n\nText of the book http://www.infoshop.org/no-wall-they-can-build/\nThe
  Ex worker podcast https://crimethinc.com/podcasts\nWelcome to Episode 11, the final
  installment of No Wall They Can Build, the Ex-Worker Podcast’s serialized audiobook
  exploring borders and migration across North America. This episode concludes the
  book with personal reflections about the author’s own journey in and out of the
  desert and the unavoidable links that bind all of us across all borders. To become
  a real force for change, those who would act in solidarity must overcome the limits
  of privilege politics and guilt, understanding our activities as fighting for our
  own lives and dismantling the illusion of separation between ourselves and others.
  What links migrants, solidarity workers, and all people struggling to survive amidst
  the disorienting nightmare of postmodern civilization is the pursuit of dignity—a
  sentiment beautifully expressed in a message sent by Rachel Corrie, an American
  solidarity worker in occupied Palestine, to her mother in 2003 just weeks before
  she was murdered by an Israeli bulldozer while attempting to stop a home demolition.
  Two final stories—one chilling and one touching—illustrate the astonishing peril
  of the desert even for experienced travelers, and the solace that unexpected alliances
  with creatures of the desert can provide for migrants and solidarity workers alike.
  Ultimately, the book concludes, to end death in the desert, to rediscover our own
  humanity, and to have any hope of our survival on this planet, there is one thing
  in common that we all must do—find our way back home.\nNotes and Links\n\n    Table
