  th 22nd of January 2018, Ursula K Le Guin passed away. This is a tribute made by
  people whose hearts have been touched by her writings. \n\nBelow are included some
  other tributes written by our comrades. \n\n\"To be clear, Ursula Le Guin didn’t,
  as I understand it, call herself an anarchist. I asked her about this. She told
  me that she didn’t call herself an anarchist because she didn’t feel that she deserved
  to—she didn’t do enough. I asked her if it was OK for us to call her one. She said
  she’d be honored.\n\nUrsula, I promise you, the honor is ours.\"\n\n- By Crimethinc,

  revolutions don’t only spread like wildfire, they spread like forests and especially
  trees. An old tree puts out many seeds that become saplings that become trees of
  their own. And then those trees put out more seeds, more saplings, more trees, and
  next thing you know the world is a forest again.”\n\nA brief tribute to Ursula K.
  Le Guin, from Rhyd Wildermuth, link:(https://godsandradicals.org/2018/01/24/grandmother-of-the-revolution/)"
