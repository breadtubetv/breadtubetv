  This text presents an argument in favor of smashing cameras and against the practice of photographing demonstrations. Arguing that the practice of taking photos is detrimental to social struggles as it increases repression, encourages passivity, and simply gets in the way â€“ this zine encourages people to adopt a confrontational approach towards photographers. Alongside this, it presents a series of suggestions and tips for photographers who identify with social struggles and who wish to see themselves as participants rather than spectators. This text raises important questions that folks need to engage with in light of the pervasive surveillance that exists in the contemporary era.
