title: No Wall They Can Build Part 7 - Designed to Kill; Who Benefits?
description: "The audiobook version of CrimeThinc's No Wall They Can Build, a book
  about immigration and border violence. \n\nText of the book http://www.infoshop.org/no-wall-they-can-build/\nThe
  Ex worker podcast https://crimethinc.com/podcast/no-wall-they-can-build-7\n\nWelcome
  to Episode 7 of No Wall They Can Build, the Ex-Worker Podcast’s serialized audiobook
  exploring borders and migration across North America. The Border Patrol, with its
  swollen budget and lavish technologies, clearly has the technical capacity to stop
  most, if not all, traffic across the border, yet their behavior seems to be at odds
  with their stated objective. This installment investigates the actual goal of border
  policy—which is not to end “illegal immigration,” but to control and manage it.
  While preventing this migration altogether would have catastrophic effects on the
  US economy, using selective enforcement to funnel traffic into increasingly remote
  areas while militarizing and hyper-policing certain areas maintains the labor supply
  while ratcheting up the profits to be made at every step in the process. A variety
  of stories—some heartbreaking, some hilarious—illustrate how this approach to enforcement
  impacts the lives of everyday people as they attempt to travel north into the United
  States. This episode identifies the various parties—both Republicans and Democrats,
  private prison and tech corporations, Mexican officials and cartels—who benefit
  from this counter-intuitive and cruel border policy… while reminding us of its horrific
  cost in human lives."
