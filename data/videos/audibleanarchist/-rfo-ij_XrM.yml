title: No wall They Can Build Part 3 Mexico,
description: "The audiobook version of CrimeThinc's No Wall They Can Build, a book
  about immigration and border violence. \nText of the book http://www.infoshop.org/no-wall-they-can-build/\nThe
  Ex worker podcast https://crimethinc.com/podcast\n\nWelcome to Episode 3 of No Wall
  They Can Build, the Ex-Worker Podcast’s serialized audiobook exploring borders and
  migration across North America. This installment begins exploring the conditions
  south of the border that drive migration north by exploring the recent history and
  economy of Mexico. As NAFTA’s “free trade” policies impoverished and displaced millions,
  border militarization altered previous patterns of seasonal migration and established
  a permanent undocumented underclass of millions in the United States. The author
  cuts through myths around the “drug war,” helping to explain the complex web of
  players from the Sinaloa and Zetas cartels to the Mexican state and the social movements
  that contest them both—and how the situation might be transformed, if US drug and
  immigration policies changed. The episode concludes with an inspiring story of the
  determined and colorful resistance to state violence by the community of San Salvador
  Atenco. This episode provides a brief introduction to the fierce, many-sided conflicts
  across Mexico resulting from the actions of the US government and exacerbated by
  the Mexican state and cartels, but always contested by popular forces."
