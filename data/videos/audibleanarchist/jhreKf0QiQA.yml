  Rudolf Rocker (1873-1958) was an anarchist writer, historian, and activist. He wrote extensively on anarchist movements and thinkers. He is perhaps best known for his book "Nationalism and Culture," which criticizes nationalism, religion, and the state.

  In this chapter, Rocker discusses the methods of anarcho-syndicalism and answers the criticism that syndicalists do not engage in political struggle. He outlines the uses of the strike (general strike and sympathetic strike), boycott, sabotage, and other methods.
