title: No Wall They Can Build Part 6 - The Border
description: "The audiobook version of CrimeThinc's No Wall They Can Build, a book
  about immigration and border violence. \nText of the book http://www.infoshop.org/no-wall-they-can-build/\nThe
  Ex worker podcast https://crimethinc.com/podcast\n\nWelcome to Episode 6 of No Wall
  They Can Build, the Ex-Worker Podcast’s serialized audiobook exploring borders and
  migration across North America. This installment investigates the three-tiered border
  and the process of crossing it, focusing on the places where the most deaths occur—southern
  Arizona and South Texas. The story of Arivaca, a small community of ranchers and
  hippies, shows how state arrogance and vigilante brutality turned the population
  towards solidarity with migrants. The complex politics of the Tohono O’odham reservation
  at Komkch’ed e Wah ‘osithk (Sells) reflect the fraught relationship between migration,
  colonialism, and the challenges facing indigenous communities today. The barren
  deserts and army base lands around Ajo mark some of the most grim and hazardous
  terrain of the entire border, while the recent surge in deaths around Falfurrias
  indicates the urgent need for further solidarity. Explanation of the actual mechanics
  of crossing the border, and the terrible perils faced by vulnerable migrants along
  the way, is supplemented by a poignant story about two flawed heroes of the desert.
  This episode paints a vivid picture of where and how migration into the United States
  actually happens, and the dangers stalking every step across the harsh landscape
  of the borderlands."
