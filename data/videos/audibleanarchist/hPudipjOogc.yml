description: "The audiobook version of CrimeThinc's No Wall They Can Build, a book
  about immigration and border violence. \nText of the book http://www.infoshop.org/no-wall-they-can-build/\nThe
  Ex worker podcast https://crimethinc.com/podcast\n\nHappy May Day, everyone! Welcome
  to Episode 5 of No Wall They Can Build, the Ex-Worker Podcast’s serialized audiobook
  exploring borders and migration across North America. Having discussed the political
  and economic forces that drive migration north, this week’s installment examines
  how people get from Central America to the US/Mexico border. The routes vary in
  risk and cost, and are stratified depending on a traveler’s wealth and nationality,
  from navigating the expensive and infuriating process of attempting to secure a
  visa to braving La Bestia, the notoriously dangerous freight trains heading north.
  Some hazard the northeastern route to Reynosa through Zetas cartel territory, while
  many traverse the northwestern route to Altar through Sinaloa cartel lands and towards
  the Sonoran desert. The “unaccompanied minors crisis” of 2013–2014 serves as a case
  study for how the machinations of powerful states, cartels, and corporations can
  impact the lives of migrants. Understanding the dynamics of border crossing requires
  an in-depth look at the economics of the marijuana trade, concluding with a thought-provoking
  analysis of politics of drug legalization and an unflinching look at the customs
  and border patrol corruption that makes the trade possible. This episode reframes
  our understanding of the multi-stage process of migrating north and the power relations
  and economic imperatives that shape the experiences of migrants as they set off
  into the desert towards the United States."
