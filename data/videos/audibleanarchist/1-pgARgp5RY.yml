title: No Wall They Can Build - Part 2
description: "The audiobook version of CrimeThinc's No Wall They Can Build, a book
  about immigration and border violence. \nText of the book http://www.infoshop.org/no-wall-they-can-build/
  \n\nThe Ex worker podcast https://crimethinc.com/podcast\n\nThis installment continues
  last week’s introduction by Defining Terms—just what do we mean by the border, migrants,
  refugees, solidarity workers, and other key phrases? To begin the long section describing
  movement From South to North, The Aftermath lays out an unflinching view of the
  500-year history of colonization, slavery, and genocide on which today’s capitalist
  economy and border regimes are based, followed by a harrowing tale of survival by
  a desert migrant. The Travelers lays out the forces pushing migrants from Mexico
  and the Northern Triangle (Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras) north towards the
  United States, illustrating the economics of the situation through a moving story
  in which migrants and solidarity workers work out the mathematics of international
  exploitation together. This chapter demystifies the basic dynamics at play in North
  American migration and evocatively illustrates their human cost."
