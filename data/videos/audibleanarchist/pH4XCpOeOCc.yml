  "My friends, let us hurry on the Revolution as quickly as we can, since, as you see, our enemies are letting us die like this - in prison or in exile, or crazed with sorrow" - Spoken by Cafiero at Giuseppe Fanelli's funeral.

  "The common wealth being scattered right across the planet, while belonging to the whole of humanity, those who happen to be within reach of that wealth and in a position to make use of it will utilise it in common. . . . As part of humanity, they will exercise here, in fact and directly, their rights over a portion of mankind's wealth. But should an inhabitant of Peking visit this country, he would enjoy the same rights as the rest, in common with the others, he would enjoy all the wealth of the country, just as he would have in Peking." [From Anarchy and Communism, a report given by Cafiero to the Congress of the Jura Federation of the IWMA in 1880. In Daniel Gu√©rin, No Gods, No Masters, Book 1, p. 250]

  "Carlo was first of all great for his inner nature, for the affect treasure, for the ingenuousness of his faith. These memories must not be lost, even today that there is the need to elevate the moral level of anarchists, who must react against the egoism and brutality that invade us, to return to unselfishness, to the sacrificial spirit, to the sentiment of love, of which Carlo was such a splendid example". - Errico Malatesta, in a letter to Serafino Mazzotti.
