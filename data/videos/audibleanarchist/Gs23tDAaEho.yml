  Pao Ching-yen (zh:鮑敬言) (also transliterated as Bao Jingyan) was a Chinese Taoist libertarian philosopher who lived 405-466 AD.

  A successor of Laozi and Zhuang Zhou in the politically-ethically libertarian strain of Taoism, Pao Ching-yen was, according to Etienne Balazs “China’s first political anarchist.” He extended the arguments in the Zhuangzi to deeply critique State authority and power.
