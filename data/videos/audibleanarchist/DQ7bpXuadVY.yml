  Bookchin (1921-2006) was an anarchist and libertarian socialist political theorist,
  historian, and author. He is perhaps best remembered as a thinker who fused critical
  ecology with anarchist thought, but his conceptions of democratic confederalism
  have influenced numerous social and political movements, including the Democratic
  Federation of Northern Syria (also know as Rojava). \n\nIn part 3, Bookchin discusses
  how classical libertarian principles can be combined with ecological thought in
  order to address the crises inherent to late-stage capitalism."
