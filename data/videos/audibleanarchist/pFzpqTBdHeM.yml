  Bookchin (1921-2006) was an anarchist and libertarian socialist political theorist,
  historian, and author. He is perhaps best remembered as a thinker who fused critical
  ecology with anarchist thought, but his conceptions of democratic confederalism
  have influenced numerous social and political movements, including the Democratic
  Federation of Northern Syria (also know as Rojava). \n\nIn part 2, Bookchin discusses
  how the increased centralization of society has led to increased environmental damage
  through energy usage and pollution. The solution, he contends, is to decentralize
  society through anarchist revolution in order to create a society that is in harmony
  with nature. For humanity to reach any ecological goal, it must become decentralized
  and anarchistic, thereby allowing individuals to create diverse social and ecological
  relationships."
