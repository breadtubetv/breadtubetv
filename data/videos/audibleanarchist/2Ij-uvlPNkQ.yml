title: No Wall They Can Build Part 8 - The Border Patrol, The Game, and The Desert
description: "The audiobook version of CrimeThinc's No Wall They Can Build, a book
  about immigration and border violence. \n\nText of the book http://www.infoshop.org/no-wall-they-can-build/\nThe
  Ex worker podcast https://crimethinc.com/podcasts/no-wall-they-can-build/episodes/8\n\nWelcome
  to Episode 8 of No Wall They Can Build, the Ex-Worker Podcastâ€™s serialized audiobook
  exploring borders and migration across North America. This installment continues
  to explore the reality of border policy by taking a closer look at the agency that
  enforces it, describing the atrocities that its agents perpetrate and their mindsets
  to justify it. The Border Patrol is merely one of the largest and most vicious players
  in a game that brings lucrative profits to a host of players on both sides of the
  border, at the expense of the vulnerable migrants who are driven into the desert.
  The episode concludes with a discussion of the environmental landscape of the desert
  itself and a poignant reflection on its harsh beauty, envisioning the healing of
  the land when one day it will no longer be scarred by borders."
