title: The War on Terra - Canada vs Australia [RAP NEWS 17]
description: "It's 2013 and the world did not end by meteorite or by Mayan calendar.
  But fear not: we might just be able to get the job done ourselves. Join Robert Foster
  as he sets out to discover where Civilisation™ is making the fastest progress towards
  annihilation. In this edition of the Civilisation Report, Robert learns about Australia
  and Canada - two oft-neglected pioneers of peace, progress and prosperity - in conversation
  with our antipodean colonial correspondent Ken Oathcarn and his Canuck counterpart,
  Fagin Heighbard. Dear viewers, consider this a fair warning that in terms of language
  and affront to the dominant culture this could get fucking messy. \n\n- Written
  & created by Giordano Nanni & Hugo Farrant in a suburban backyard home-studio in
  Melbourne, Australia - on Wurundjeri Land.\n\n- Gratitude to our donors whose generosity
