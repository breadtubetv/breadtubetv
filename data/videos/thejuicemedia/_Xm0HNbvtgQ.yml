title: 'Episode XIII: A News Hope [RAP NEWS 13]'
description: "It is a period of corporate war. Without an honest media Is an honest
  media the people Planet Earth are kept misinformed and in perpetual conflict and
  competition. But is there a Force than can restore peace and balance to the Galaxy?
  To find out, we consult two of journalism's most influential and inflammatory figures:
  Rebel journalist, enfant terrible, Julian Assange, who awaits a verdict in London
  which could see him 'Sextradited' to Sweden. And, on the opposite end of the journalistic
  spectrum, Rupert Murdoch, head of the mighty NewsCorp media Empire, embroiled in
  legal scandals that go to the highest and lowest levels of celebrity in Britain.
  In the manichean manner of some ancient laser sword and forcery epic, join the most
  retro news-anchor in the Galaxy, Robert Foster, as he attempts to wrangle these
  two figures together for a rap-debate. Will the light or the dark side prevail -
  and is it really that easy to know which is which? How many Bothans died to bring
  us this information? Is the Force Estate with Robert? Will we see THE RETURN OF
  THE JOURNALI before the EMPIRE EXTRADITES BACK? For answers to all these questions
  and more, pull down your blast shields, switch off your on-board computer and feel
  the Force in this latest episode of Juice Rap News... or click play.\n\nCONNECT
