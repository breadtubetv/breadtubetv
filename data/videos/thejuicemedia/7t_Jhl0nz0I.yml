description: "Samantha Chalmers at the site of the Aboriginal Embassy, Australia,
  Invasion Day (Jan 26th) 2009. \n\n\"I can't walk around with my shoes on, my natural
  shoes that I was born with - the 60,000 year old shoes? I can't apparently. I shouldnt;
  people worry for me. Consider your cultural design people. You're stopping yourself
  from living.\"\n\nThis is the very first video interview by the Juice Media."
