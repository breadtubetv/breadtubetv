title: 'Barbara Shaw: ''The Intervention is a land grab - where are the pedophile
  rings & rivers of grog?'''
description: "Barbara Shaw, from Mt Nancy town camp near Alice Springs, talks in Melbourne
  on 27th August 2009 about the Northern territory Intervention, which began in 2007
  under the Howard Government and is being extended under the Rudd Labour Government.
  \r\n\r\nIndigenous Affairs Minister Jenny Macklin announced in July '09 that Town
  Camps in the NT would be paid $100m to sign 40 year leases making the residents
  tenants under the Territory Government.  Should they refuse, Macklin threatened,
  the Government will compulsorily acquire the town camps under the special powers
  provided by the Emergency Response Legislation, which was pushed through Parliament
  in 2007. \r\n\r\nIn response, Barbara Shaw has lodged two injuctions - or 'stays
  of execution' - against Macklin, stating that she did not inform the tenants that
  their right were going to be extinguished. The Federal Court will now proceed to
  a full hearing on Monday August 31st. \r\n\r\nMore to come in the next few days...

  injunction is down to Macklin'\r\nhttp://www.crikey.com.au/2009/08/07/alice-camps-injunction-is-down-to-macklin/\r\n\r\nCrikey:
  'Macklin botches Alice Springs town camp compulsory acquisition'\r\nhttp://www.crikey.com.au/2009/07/27/macklin-botches-alice-springs-town-camp-compulsory-acquisition/\r\n\r\nAlso,
  very importantly, the UN Special Rapporteur on the Situation of Human Rights and
  Fundamental Freedoms of Indigenous Peoples, Prof James Anaya, has recently visited
  the Northern Territory on a 11 day trip (17-28 August 2009). He also met with Barbara
  Shaw, who introduced him to one of the town camps near Alice. His report has condemned
  the Northern Territory Intervention as 'Racist' and he has urged Canberra to reinstate
  the Racial Discrimination Act asap. Anaya will present the Report to the UN at the
  next Human Rights Council meeting. Take a read of the Report here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.unhchr.ch/huricane/huricane.nsf/view01/313713727C084992C125761F00443D60?opendocument\r\n\r\nBoth
  the Government and the Opposition have responded in the most embarrassing manner
  possible, by choosing to completely disregard the Report of this distinguished Rapporteur:\r\n\r\nTony
  Abbott: 'Abbott says calls from UN expert Anaya \"nonsense\"'\r\nhttp://www.news.com.au/story/0,27574,25992824-29277,00.html\r\n\r\nAnd
  Warren Mundine:\r\n'Warren Mundine ~versus~ James Anaya'\r\nhttp://slackbastard.anarchobase.com/?p=6610\r\n\r\nAnd
  of course, Rupert Murdoch's opinion in The Australian: 'He came, he saw and missed
  the point'\r\nhttp://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,25995837-16741,00.html"
