  the 2014 soccer World Coup - the most watched sporting event on the planet. Join
  Robert Foster as he investigates why many Brazilians are protesting against THIEFA,
  the shady organisation that runs the World Cup, and the rather fascist policies
  it has introduced to their country \"for the good of the game\". But Brazil is not
  the only country to get shafted in this epic episode, which features exclusive interviews
  with captains of the strongest teams in the running for the notorious WORLD COUP.
  So, click play and find out why they really call it \"The World Game.\"\n\nWritten
