title: Big Brother is WWWatching You - feat. George Orwell [RAP NEWS 15]
description: "The Internet. Will it remain the one open frequency where humanity can
  bypass filters and barriers, or become the greatest spying machine ever imagined?
  The future is being coded as we type. Across Oceania, States have been erecting
  and installing measures to legalise the watching, tracking and storage of data of
  party-members and proles alike. If such plans materialize, will this place ever
  be the same? Join our plucky host Robert Foster as he conducts an incisive analysis
  of the situation at hand. Joining him are newly appointed Thought Police General
  at the Pentopticon, Darth O'Brien Baxter, and a surprisingly lucid Terence Winston
  Moonseed. Once again, in the midst of this Grand Human Experiment, we ask tough
  questions about our future. Will it involve a free internet which will continue
  to revolutionise the way the world communicates with itself? Or is our picture of
  the future a Boot stamping on this Human InterFace forever?\n\nWritten & created
