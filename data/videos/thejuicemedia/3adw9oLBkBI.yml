title: WWWAR on the Internet - feat. Wikileaks vs The Pentagon [RAP NEWS 4]
description: "We resume our lyrical forays into the world of rhyme and reason, exploring
  the importance of the Internets. Robert Foster casts a critical rhyme over Senator
  Joe (Lie)berman's proposed bill to shut down the world-wide-web in case of [quotation
  mark] an emergency [/quotation mark]. \n\nBut - most importantly - we discuss something
  else which has been leaking even more profusely than a BP oil well. An organisation
  of ultra-inspiring infectively-courageous cybernauts - aka Wikileaks - has been
  taking on the Fistagon and giving that slumbering Fourth Estate a much-needed kick
  in the arse, reminding us how important the internet is as a tool for open information
  and for holding corrupt government to account.\n\nWhat is Wikileaks? Who is Julian
  Assange? And why is it so important that we know what's happening right now? Find
  out with your charming host, Robert Foster. \n\n**Episode dedicated to Mama Wolf
  - happy birthday!**\n\nWritten by Giordano Nanni; lyrics and performance by Hugo
  Farrant. Created by Farrant & Nanni in a back-yard studio in suburban Melbourne,
  on Wurundjeri Land.\n\n*******************************\nSUPPORT Rap News so we can
