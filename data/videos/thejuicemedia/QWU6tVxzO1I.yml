title: Game of Polls - feat. Julian Assange [RAP NEWS 20]
description: "Rap News season finale: Episode 20 - A Game Of Polls. A messenger raven
  has arrived in the Juice Media studio bearing tidings from the land of Australios:
  Elections are Coming. The perpetually warring factions and severely inbred families
  from across the Australian political sphere are squaring up in a more than usually
  bloody campaign. It's Right versus slightly more Right in the election to end all
  elections for a few years. Join Robert Foster as he meets the bloodthirsty players
  in this violent saga. Who will slay whom? Who will prevail and claim the Irony Throne
  in Canberra? Who is that mysterious platinum-haired challenger in exile overseas?
  All these questions and more will be ignored in this celebratory 20th episode of
  Rap News.\n\n- Written & created by Giordano Nanni & Hugo Farrant in a suburban
  backyard home-studio in Melbourne, Australia - on Wurundjeri Land.\n\n** SUPPORT
