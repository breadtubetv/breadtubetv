title: Australia Day - with Ken Oathcarn (PG - family friendly version) [RAP NEWS
  11]
description: "Australia Day. It's a day of high jinx, high revelry and high people
  in Australia; a day when a large and vocal majority come together to \"celebrate
  what's great\" about this country. But what is the meaning of all this fanfare?
  What is the true origin of this passionately marked day of facepaint and binge drinking?
  Is everyone in Australia so keen on this particular anniversary? To get to bottom
  of these questions, and more, join your amiable host Robert Foster as he conducts
  a high-octane, high-frequency satellite link-up with a representative of the Mainstream
  Australian media: multi-Logie award-winning broadcaster, entertainer, emu-wrangler
  and true blue Aussie, Kenneth Oathcarn. WARNING: contains adult Australian vernacular
  - viewer discretion is strongly advised.\n\nJuice Rap News: written and created
  by Giordano Nanni and Hugo Farrant. Performed by Hugo Farrant (Robert Foster) &
  Giordano Nanni (Ken Oathcarn), in a back-yard studio in suburban Melbourne - on
  the lands of the Wurundjeri people.\n\n** MP3 and Lyrics: http://www.reverbnation.com/rapnews\n**
