  SOURCES AND FURTHER READING:\n1. Here's the report by Orima on the trials, however
  it's not easy to interpret these results: https://www.dss.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/08_2017/cashless_debit_card_trial_evaluation_-_final_evaluation_report.pdf\n2.
  So I recommend you check out the explanation of the results by Dr Janet Hunt, from
  ANU: https://caepr.cass.anu.edu.au/sites/default/files/docs/CAEPR_Topical_Issues_1_2017_0.pdf\n3.
  Here's the evidence for the claim that the Cashless Debit Card is:\n• Ineffective
  - see Auditor General report which says there was no evidence that it reduces social
  harm (Australian National Audit Office (ANAO), 2018)\n• Expensive - it costs over
  $10-12,000 per person (see ANAO, 2018 and Senate Committee hearings) \n• Harmful
  – 32 per cent of respondents to the government evaluation said it made their lives
  worse (Orima, 2017) \n• Unsupported - the government evaluation acknowledged that
  the CDCT did not have universal support from the local community (Orima, 2017) \n•
  Discriminatory - breaches human rights of privacy and social security (Parliamentary
  Joint Committee on Human Rights, Community Affairs Legislation Committee, 2018)
  \n•  Paternalistic - it removes people's agency to manage their affairs (Parliamentary
  Joint Committee on Human Rights, Community Affairs Legislation Committee, 2018).\n4.
