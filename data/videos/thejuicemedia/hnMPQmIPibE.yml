title: WHISTLEBLOWER - feat. Edward Snowden & Glen Greenwald [RAP NEWS 19]
description: "A Rap News summary of the past week's remarkable series of events. It
  started off as a slow news day, and a routine update on the state of the Free World
  Order with NSA Director General Baxter. But then the news broke of startling revelations
  from the fearless paladin of adversarial journalism, guardian of civil liberties,
  journalist Glen Greenwald, concerning a shadowy spying program called PRISM. Who
  is behind these revelations, and how should we view them? How will the Authorities,
  and the Corporations implicated, respond? Join Robert Foster for a whirlwind summary
  of the events in this ongoing saga... in Rap News 19\n\n- Written & created by Giordano
  Nanni & Hugo Farrant in a suburban backyard home-studio in Melbourne, Australia
  - on Wurundjeri Land.\n\n** SUPPORT the production of new episodes of Juice Rap
