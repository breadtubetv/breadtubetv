title: '"THE NEWS" - feat Sage Francis [RAP NEWS 21]'
description: "\"The News\" - the most viral meme of reality on the planet. If it's
  not on \"the News\" it didn't happen - right? Welcome back to  Season 2 of Juice
  Rap News, in which intrepid anchorman Robert Foster embarks on a new era of adversarial
  rap journalism by casting a critical eye on the paradigm that shapes our collective
  reality each night; featuring a smorgasbord of guests, from the stalwart General
  Baxter and Terence Moonseed having a friendly chat on about the Trans-Pacific Partnership
  (TPP), to our special correspondents in Russia and the Colonies. Meanwhile, what
  is going on in Finance, Show­biz and the Weather? Special surprise guests are in
  tow to cover all this and more, helping Robert delve deeper into this very odd phenomenon
  of 'The News' itself.\n\n­Written & created by Giordano Nanni & Hugo Farrant in
  a suburban backyard home studio in Melbourne, Australia, ­on Wurundjeri Land.\n\n**CREDITS:\nMain
