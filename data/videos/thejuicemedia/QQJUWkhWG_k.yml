title: 'Les Malezer & Robbie Thorpe interview: a Treaty for Australia'
description: "The Juice speaks to Les Malezer just after his delivery of the 2009
  Mabo Lecture in Melbourne on June 3rd. We asked him a few questions about the road
  ahead for Australia and Aboriginal Land Rights. Here are some of the key juicy points
  made:\r\n\r\n1. The Australian Government is under certain human rights obligations
  which it is not fulfilling. --Especially so since it signed the United Nations Declaration
  on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples: http://www.hreoc.gov.au/social_justice/declaration/assembly.html
  \r\n\r\n2. There is a need to depart from the Native Title process and to go back
  to focusing on Land Rights: \"We have to forget about using the Native Title process;
  it's not working. Lets insist upon a land Rights process, like the one we started
  in 1985 with the Hawke Government, when they promised us National Land Rights Legislation.\"\r\n\r\n3.
  The Government must start focusing on OUTCOMES rather than processes- for instance,
  setting quotas aside (eg 5% of the State) for Aboriginal land. The system must cease
  putting claimants through bureaucratic hoops. It must instead address the obligations
  it has towards Aboriginal peoples -- ie: restitution of land.\r\n\r\n4. Treaty is
  the way to go to address the unresolved Australian situation. It establishes the
  principles of Rights. The UN Declaration provides a platform to allow Aboriginal
  Peoples to make their own governments and treaties--\r\n\r\nTreaty:  \"We may as
  well get people used to the word\"\r\n\r\n5. Human rights obligations and International
  pressure, rather than public pressure, are needed to push Government to form treaties.
  It is then the Governement's job to explain to Australians why it is necessary to
  make such treaties.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, due to noisy lawn tractors operating on
  the pitch, parts of the interview have been edited out :( \r\n\r\nFilmed at the
  MCG, Melbourne.\r\nRobbie Thorpe's website: http://www.treatyrepublic.net"
