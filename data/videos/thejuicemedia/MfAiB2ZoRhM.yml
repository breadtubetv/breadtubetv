title: Honest Government Ad | Visit Hawai'i!
description: "The US Government made a tourism ad for Hawai'i, and it's surprisingly
  honest and informative. \n\nI had the opportunity to visit Hawai'i at the start
  of the month and talk with local and native Hawaiians. They all said the biggest
  problem they face is the fact that so few people are aware of the history of US
  military occupation. So on my return to Australia, I decided to make a video about
  it. Giordano\n\n-*- Ways you can support us to keep making videos: \n-- Become a
