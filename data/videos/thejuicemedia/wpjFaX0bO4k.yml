title: A Game of Polls - feat. Julian Assange [RAP NEWS 20 - Censored version]
description: "*originally uploaded 25 August 2013* --- Rap News season finale: Episode
  20 - A Game Of Polls. A messenger raven has arrived in the Juice Media studio bearing
  tidings from the land of Australios: Elections are Coming. The perpetually warring
  factions and severely inbred families from across the Australian political sphere
  are squaring up in a more than usually bloody campaign. It's Right versus slightly
  more Right in the election to end all elections for a few years. Join Robert Foster
  as he meets the bloodthirsty players in this violent saga. Who will slay whom? Who
  will prevail and claim the Irony Throne in Canberra? Who is that mysterious platinum-haired
  challenger in exile overseas? All these questions and more will be ignored in this
  celebratory 20th episode of Rap News. \n\n- Written & created by Giordano Nanni
  & Hugo Farrant in a suburban backyard home-studio in Melbourne, Australia - on Wurundjeri
