  WHAT CAN YOU DO ABOUT IT?\n-- If you’d like to support our neighbours in Timor-Leste,
  this is an organization that supports Timorese women and children and is not affiliated
  to Australia’s foreign-aid complex (hence why not tax deductible): https://www.etwa.org.au\n\n--
  You can also write to the Attorney General Christian Porter asking him to exercise
  his power under s.71 of the Judiciary Act to drop the prosecution of Witness K and
  Bernard Collaery. Here’s his email christian.porter.mp@aph.gov.au (please keep it
  clean).\n\n-- Lastly, you can help raise awareness about this whole shitshow by
  sharing the video with your friends.\n\n-*- CREDITS: \n-- Produced by Patrons of
