title: The War on Journalism - with Julian Assange [RAP NEWS 5]
description: "Who let the Logs out!? Wikileaks drops 400,000 classified documents
  shedding new light on the Iraq war—the biggest leak of classified military documents
  in history—sending shockwaves across the Fourth Estate. Rap News marks the occasion
  by inviting into the studio the former US Secretary of Offense, Donald Rumsfeld.
  But what starts out as a conventional Rap News interview soon descends into mayhem
  as the live feed is hijacked by News World Order, eager to spin the record like
  a disc jockey on crack. Enter Bill O'Really, the champion of Fair & Balanced journalism,
  dragging us screaming into the No Spine Zone. Only divine intervention can save
  us now, from a fate worse than death. But beware of imitators; not all is what it
  seems to be! Join us for a rollercoaster episode of Rap News, featuring a very very
  special guest appearance.\n\nJuice Rap News: written by Giordano Nanni; lyrics and
  performance by Hugo Farrant. Created by Farrant & Nanni in a back-yard studio in
  suburban Melbourne.\n\n****************************************************************************************\nUSEFUL
