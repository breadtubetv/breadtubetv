title: The New World Order - with Russel Brand & Bill de Berg (RAP NEWS 30)
description: "The New World Order: They control the world's governments; THEY rule
  over all of us from the top of the pyramid. While WE suffer at the bottom. Right?
  Today we blow open the truth about the NWO in order to shed light on this widespread
  conspiracy which has frequently been invoked to explain the state of our world.
  Join intrepid host Robert Foster as he takes control of the lever of critical inquiry,
  alongside special guests Russell Brand, conspiracy guru Terrence Moonseed, and NWO
  representative William De Berg, in order to ask: who is the New World Order? And
  how can we stop it? \n\nWarning: This episode of Rap News has been in the making
  since we started the show, 5 years ago. No punches will be pulled, no quarter will
  be given, and no depth will be left unplumbed on this arduous quest for the harsh
  truth. Welcome to the New World Order, bitches.\n\nWritten by Giordano Nanni, Rhymed
  & Performed by Hugo Farrant - in a suburban backyard home studio in Melbourne, Australia,
  on Wurundjeri Land.\n\n☛ CREDITS:\n* Beats: \n- 'Fight Back': https://soundcloud.com/profetesa/profetesa-beats-fight-back-eminem-d12-type-beat-instrumental
