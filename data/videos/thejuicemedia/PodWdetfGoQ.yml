title: 'Uncle Chappy Williams: ''Always was, always will be'' - Aboriginal Tent Embassy'
description: "Neville Williams ('Uncle Chappie') speaks from the site of the Aboriginal
  Embassy on Invasion Day 2009 (January 26th a.k.a 'Australia day'). \r\n\r\n[from
  Wiki:] \"The Tent Embassy promotes Australian Aboriginal Sovereignty. Their demands
  included land rights and mineral rights to Aboriginal lands, legal and political
  control of certain sacred sites, and compensation for land that they claim was stolen.
  Their demands have been consistently rebuffed by past and current governments. It
  has also been used as a site for protesting against other issues, such as against
  uranium mining at Jabiluka in the Northern Territory during the 90s. Currently Elders
  such as Uncle Neville Williams, from the Aboriginal Tent Embassy are working to
  protect traditional Wiradjuri land in Western N.S.W at Lake Cowal which is in the
  process of being mined for gold. \r\n\r\nOn Australia Day 1972, the Tent Embassy
  was established in response to the McMahon Coalition Government's refusal to recognise
  Aboriginal land rights and saw a new general purpose lease for Aborigines which
  would be conditional upon their intention and ability to make reasonable economic
  and social use of land and it would exclude all rights they had to mineral and forest
  rights. The embassy has existed intermittently since then, and continuously since
  1992. Some of the people involved in its establishment include Gary Foley, Chicka
  Dixon, Pearl Gibbs and Paul Coe.\""
