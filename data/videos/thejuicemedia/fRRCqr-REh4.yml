title: Pope Francis Raps the 10 Commandments [RAP NEWS 33]
description: |-
  Today on Rap News, a world exclusive: Pope Francis performing his 2015 encyclical on climate change, revealing his new, revised Ten Climate Commandments for the care of our common home. Of course, Robert Foster also has a couple of pointed questions to pose to the Pontiff; as does our resident conspiracy pioneer, Terrence Moonseed. Join us as we beam in to the Vatican to hear Pope Francis spit hot fire on global warming. It’s Pope Francis vs Climate Change… Lord help us.

  Written & created by Giordano Nanni & Hugo Farrant in a suburban backyard home studio in Melbourne, Australia, on Wurundjeri Land.
