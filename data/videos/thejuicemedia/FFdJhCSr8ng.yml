  Hello to everyone out there who's been wondering what's happened to Rap News and when the next video will be coming. We made this special video to update you all on the status of Season 4, to reward you all for your patience, and to provide some relief to all those yearning for the Juice.

  This is for our dedicated audience out there, featuring some never before seen behind-the-scenes views of JRN HQ, and the two of us in our first ever appearance on the show. (Kind of)

  We hope you enjoy this chaotic little update video as you wait for Season 4 to commence - very soon!
