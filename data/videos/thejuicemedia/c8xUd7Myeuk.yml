title: Higgs Boson Unbound - feat. Prof. Scott Ridley [RAP NEWS 14]
description: "Our Promethean quest for ultimate meaning has taken a giant leap towards
  its epic conclusion. In the latest prequel to humanity's journey to inner-space,
  scientists at the CERN laboratory announce that they have unlocked one of the key
  strands in the origin of Life, The Universe and Everything: 42 years on from its
  coining, the Higgs Boson particle has possibly been detected at the Large Hadron
  Collider. What does it all mean? How does it feel to meet our Masster? What is our
  destiny? Could this be the font of all wisdom? Does it anti-matter that Scientists
  make use of 'Comic Sans' - the font of all evil? Is anyone conCERNed about the MASS
  amount of Higgslarious Pun-upmanship Colliding in the twittersphere? Join Robert
  Foster as he takes a journalistic journey into this particular world, and manages
  to corner a colourful character, CERN-FI Professor Scott Ridley, who is several
  bottles into getting his Booze-on at the massive \"Hadron Collider Higgs Boson PARTYcle\"
  celebration. \n\nWritten & created by Giordano & Hugo; performed by Hugo.\n\nCONNECT
