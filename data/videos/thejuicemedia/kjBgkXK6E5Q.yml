title: The Great Barrier Reef [Rap News Call Out]
description: |-
  Robert Foster presents an express Rap News Call Out report featuring correspondent Ken Oathcarn, who's found himself in one of the most incredible areas of natural beauty in the world - the Great Barrier Reef! Surely nobody would be allowed to dredge, damage and dump coal dust all over this natural wonder of the world? Well, that very much depends on you...

  1. Use this tool to email your bank and tell them you don't want them to finance Adani & Abbot Point: https://www.getup.org.au/campaigns/great-barrier-reef--3/contact-your-bank/contact-your-bank

  2. Check this list to find out which banks and credit unions do not invest in fossil fuels, and if necessary switch to them instead: http://www.marketforces.org.au/banks/compare (click on 'All Banks' at the top of the table to see the full list)
