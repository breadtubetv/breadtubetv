title: Fate of the Internet - RAP NEWS 35 - feat. Dan Bull
description: |-
  The time has come to turn our focus onto the very medium which allows us to connect: The Internet. As we know it today, it has only been around for a short time: it's still an adolescent; still changing and growing. But even as we speak, powerful forces and interests are vying to influence and shape it’s nature as it reaches full maturity. And since humanity’s destiny and that of the Internet are intimately connected, it would be wise to be ask: how is the Internet doing? If the Internet could speak to us as a human today, what kind of person would it be? And most importantly, what kind of a person will it become in the future? Log in with Robert Foster as he poses these very questions to some of the most influential and powerful figures who are today shaping the Internet’s future. Featuring an world-exclusive, world-first appearance from the Internet itself. Only on Juice Rap News.

  Written by Giordano Nanni, Rhymed & Performed by Hugo Farrant - in a suburban backyard home studio in Melbourne, Australia, on Wurundjeri Land.
