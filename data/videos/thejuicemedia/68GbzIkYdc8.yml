title: Yes We KONY [RAP NEWS 12]
description: "Before Gangnam Style there was Kony - 2012's first globe-consuming meme,
  which has highlighted the plight of African child soldiering like never before.
  But is it really good? Is it really bad? Or is the world really more complex than
  'good guys' and 'bad guys'? Whatevers; one thing's for sure, this is momentous:
  never had a 27-minute video devoid of both cats and boobs ever achieved such virality.
  Is this a demonstration of the internet's ability to instantly inform and engage
  tens of millions; and a hopeful sign that there is a willingness among those millions,
  to engage passionately with something more meaningful? Or does Kony2012 just mark
  the dawn of a rapacious new era of viral humanitarian marketing? Join your charitable
  host Robert Foster - and our special guest, General Baxter, direct from AFRICOM
  - as we delve into the dark heart of the matter.\n\nSUPPORT the creation of new
