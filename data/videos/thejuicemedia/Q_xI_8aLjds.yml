title: The 2nd Heliocentric Revolution - feat. Copernicus [RAP NEWS 22]
description: "Like others that preceded us, our \"civilisation\" faces an Energy Crisis,
  one that threatens to bring an end to our brief joyride since the industrial revolution.
  And yet, our dirty little secret is seldom mentioned in the news, let alone connected
  to economic instability or to environmental effects on our planet. It falls to Robert
  Foster to bring this topic back into the fore of our consciousness, where he conducts
  an incisive analysis of the situation to see what solutions are out there to deal
  with peak energy. Join your ever-curious anchor as he invites a panoply of guests
  - the great, the good, the bizarre, and the downright trollsome - along to share
  their solutions to this crisis. In the end, the shift required might have to be
  psychological as well as technological. Enjoy the ride, fellow children of the industrial
  revolution. \n\n­Written & created by Giordano Nanni & Hugo Farrant in a suburban
  backyard home studio in Melbourne, Australia, ­on Wurundjeri Land.\n\n**CREDITS:\n\nBEAT:
