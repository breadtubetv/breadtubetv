description: "April 19, 2010 Cochabamba, Bolivia.\r\n\r\nForget corporate climate
  politics in Copenhagen: the World People's Conference on Climate Change and the
  rights of Mother Earth is currently being held in Cochambamba, Bolivia, hosted by
  president Evo Morales. Key on the agenda is to press for a global referendum on
  climate-change and the creation of a Climate Justice Court at the United Nations.\r\n\r\nVoices
  of the People:\r\n\r\nDay 1, 7:30am. Though the conference has not been officially
  inaugurated by Bolivian President Evo Morales, bus loads of people are pouring in
  at the Universidad del Valle, Tiquipaya, Cochabamba. People from various parts of
  the world, people from different ethnic groups in Bolivia are gathered outside the
  gate of the university.\r\n\r\nWhy have these people decided to attend this conference?
  We asked a few people from the crowd this and their hopes of what this conference
  could achieve.\r\n\r\nFor more information, visit \r\nhttp://envivocmpcc.org.bo\r\nwww.democracynow.org\r\nwww.earthcycles.net
