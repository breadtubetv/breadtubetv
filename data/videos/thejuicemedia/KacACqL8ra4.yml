title: Understanding the Northern Territory Intervention - Part 1
description: "August 2009: Intervention Update: Indigenous Affairs Minister Jenny
  Macklin has announced that the Commonwealth Government of Australia is going to
  compulsorily acquire Aboriginal Community Town Camps in the Northern Territory.
  This will start happening from early August 2009. \r\n\r\nThe main focus so far
  has been on the Tangentyere Council which is based in Alice Springs. Tangentyere
  provides services to the 1,600 people from most Central Australian tribal groups
  living on the 18 town camps around the town. Over the years the council has been
  a spearhead for the establishment of other organisations as the need arose, such
  as Central Australian Aboriginal Congress (medical services), Central Australian
  Aboriginal Alcohol Planning Unit (alcohol rehabilitation), Institute for Aboriginal
  Development (educational institution), Central Australian Aboriginal Legal Aid Service,
  Yipirinye School (independent Aboriginal school), outstation resource centres and
  so on. \r\n\r\nThe NT Intervention took out compulsory 5-year leases over the town
  camps serviced by Tangentyere, along with outstations and other remote communities.
  The government said it needed powers to build housing quickly but not a single house
  has been built for Aboriginal people through the Intervention. Communities across
  the NT have been told that no housing will be built until long-term leases are signed
  with government. Town camps are now under threat of having their living areas compulsorily
  acquired permanently by the Federal Government and their housing stock given to
  the Northern Territory Government to manage. Most town camp residents have experienced
  tenancy under Territory Housing and know it doesnt work for them.\r\n\r\n Tangentyere,
  on behalf of its client group, wants to embrace the move taking place nationally
  towards community housing models. With government support they have undergone the
  process of setting up the Central Australian Affordable Housing Company and are
  keen to move ahead with this. They have implored the government to work in partnership
  with them and respect their right to have a say in the plans for their lives and
  for future generations. Town camps are special purpose leases in perpetuity and
  are set up as Aboriginal communal living areas. This is not nepotism: this is how
  Aboriginal people live together and support each other. \r\n\r\nA campaign in support
  of Tangentyere Council, its constituent members (the Housing Associations) and retention
  of its autonomy is growing nationally. Many more people need to raise their voices
  against this injustice. We are calling for public endorsement of the Statement opposing
  the Commonwealths proposal to compulsorily acquire the Alice Springs town camps.
  It is planned to publish this Statement and endorsements in the national media on
  30 July, on the first day of the Australian Labor Partys national conference and
  one week prior to the governments planned takeover date of August 5. \r\n\r\nSigned
