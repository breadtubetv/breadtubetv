description: "Intervention update: Compulsory land acquisitions in the Northern Territory
  to start from August '09. Sandra Onus - Gournditch-Mara Elder, Melbourne, 29 July
  2009\r\n\r\nIndigenous Affairs Minister Jenny Macklin has announced that the Commonwealth
  Government of Australia is going to compulsorily acquire Aboriginal Community Town
  Camps in the Northern Territory. This will start happening from early August 2009.\r\n\r\nThe
  main focus has been on the Tangentyere Council which is based in Alice Springs.
  Tangentyere provides services to the 1,600 people from most Central Australian tribal
  groups living on the 18 town camps around the town.\r\n\r\nOver the years the council
  has been a spearhead for the establishment of other organisations as the need arose,
  such as Central Australian Aboriginal Congress (medical services), Central Australian
  Aboriginal Alcohol Planning Unit (alcohol rehabilitation), Institute for Aboriginal
  Development (educational institution), Central Australian\r\nAboriginal Legal Aid
  Service, Yipirinye School (independent Aboriginal school), outstation resource centres
  and so on.\r\n\r\nThe NT Intervention took out compulsory 5-year leases over the
  town camps serviced by Tangentyere, along with outstations and other remote communities.
  The government said it needed powers to build housing\r\nquickly but not a single
  house has been built for Aboriginal people through the Intervention. Communities
  across the NT have been told that no housing will be built until long-term leases
  are signed with government.\r\n\r\nTown camps are now under threat of having their
  living areas compulsorily acquired permanently by the Federal Government and their
  housing stock given to the Northern Territory Government to manage. Most town camp
  residents have experienced tenancy under Territory\r\nHousing and know it doesnt
  work for them. Tangentyere, on behalf of its client group, wants to embrace the
  move taking place nationally towards community housing models. With government support
  they have undergone the process of setting up the Central Australian Affordable\r\nHousing
  Company and are keen to move ahead with this. They have implored the government
  to work in partnership with them and respect their right to have a say in the plans
  for their lives and for future generations.\r\n\r\nTown camps are special purpose
  leases in perpetuity and are set up as Aboriginal communal living areas. This is
  not nepotism: this is how Aboriginal people live together and support each other.\r\n\r\nA
  campaign in support of Tangentyere Council, its constituent members (the Housing
  Associations) and retention of its autonomy is growing nationally. Many more people
  need to raise their voices against this injustice.\r\n\r\nWe are calling for public
  endorsement of the Statement opposing the Commonwealths proposal to compulsorily
  acquire the Alice Springs town camps. It is planned to publish this Statement and
  endorsements in the national media on 30 July, on the first day of the Australian\r\nLabor
  Partys national conference and one week prior to the governments planned takeover
  date of August 5.\r\n\r\nSigned\r\n\r\nBarbara Shaw\r\nMt Nancy town camp, Intervention
