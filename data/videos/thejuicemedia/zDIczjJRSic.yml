title: 'Crimea: Media War Games - feat. Abby Martin [RAP NEWS 23]'
description: "RAP NEWS 23: CRIMEA MEDIA WAR-GAMES. It's March 2014 and following on
  from an extremely successful Winter Olympic Games, Russia decides to organise another
  fun sporting event: and the whole world's invited. Welcome to the Paramilitary Games
  in the Crimean Peninsula. Unfortunately, in spite of Russia's best intentions, the
  Western Media doesn't seem to enjoy the event as much as anticipated, and spits
  the dummy in a way that exceeds even its #SochiFail histrionics. The battle lines
  are drawn: it's East versus West in a good old fashioned media cold-shoulder war,
  with each side firing 24 hour news cycle broadsides at each other with alacrity.
  Join your host Robert Foster, caught squarely in the cross-fire as he attempts to
  navigate the salvos, and find some underlying truth. It's Mutually Assured Mass-Media
  Destruction: Crimedia Wars - and the stakes are high - who will win the War of Perception?
  It's Juice Rap News, in the thick of it, as usual... Hysteria Is Happening.\n\n­Written
  & created by Giordano Nanni & Hugo Farrant in a suburban backyard home studio in
  Melbourne, Australia, ­on Wurundjeri Land.\n\n**CREDITS:\n\nBEAT: \"Russian Roulette\"
