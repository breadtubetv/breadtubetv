title: 'Climate Change: Lord Monckton rap-battles Al Gore [RAP NEWS 3]'
description: "Al Gore finally accepts Lord Monckton's challenge to a highly uncivilized
  debate over the issue of anthropogenic climate change, as we count down to the Copenhagen
  Climate Conference - aka COP15 - in a special extended edition of ~RapNews, . \n\nIs
  it all just a lie spread by the NWO so that Obama can sign a treaty to cede US sovereignty
  and usher in a one-world government to Cap-&-Trade tax innocent carbon emitters
  and SUV drivers like you and me? Or are we truly fucked, as the latest science seems
  to suggest, and feedback loops will bring about environmental, social and economic
  meltdown and collapse before the next season of Sex and the City? Explore these
  issues, and more, with your charming host - Robert Foster.\n\nAddendum re Climate-gate:
  this vid was posted a few days before this incident took place - which is why no
  mention of it is made (no conspiracy of silence here!). As several viewers have
  rightly brought this up; but here is what we think: The 'conspiracy' is right in
  front of our eyes, not hidden in emails and behind firewalls. \n\nJuice Rap News:

  Melbourne, on Wurundjeri Land.\n\n*********************************\nLINKS:\nIndigenous
