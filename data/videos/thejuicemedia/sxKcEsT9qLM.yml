title: TRUMP vs HILLARY (Rap News 36 - Special Edition!)
description: "Hello world. RAP NEWS is back for a special episode on the 2016 USA
  Election mayhem, feat. Hillary Clinton vs Donald Trump + a touch of Jill Stein &
  Gary Johnson. This one's dedicated to all the Rap News fans out there!\n\nI'm delighted
  to bring this amazing series back to life for this historic event! I look forward
  to seeing how this episode is received. I know it won't be the same without Robert
  Foster, but hope you'll find the same spirit and juice alive and well. If you like
  this new episode, and leave lots of loving comments for the awesome new team who
  joined me to make this possible (nudge-nudge!), we might just come together again
  and bring you more Rap News videos in the future.\n\nI hope you enjoy. \nGiordano
