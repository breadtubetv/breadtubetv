title: Net Neutrality [RAP NEWS 25]
description: "RAP NEWS 25: NET NEUTRALITY. Having covered conflicts in distant lands,
  we now turn our attention to our own native homeland, the Internet; where the battle
  for the hypersphere has reached new heights, as netizens take up arms against Telcoms
  and the FCC, to preserve the fundamental ethos that made the Internet what it is
  today: Net Neutrality. What is Net Neutrality, and why is it so important to the
  future of the Internet? Find out by joining Robert Foster as he takes a whimsical
  trip into the World Wide Web, with its founder Tim Berners-Lee. Let's just hope
  no shady mega-corporatist, elite oligarchic malefactors pop up to mess with us on
  the way... \n\nWritten & created by Giordano Nanni & Hugo Farrant in a suburban
  backyard home studio in Melbourne, Australia, on Wurundjeri Land.\n\nLearn more
