description: "Stop the Dakota Access Pipeline before you leave the White House. \n\nUPDATE:
  Looks like Obama remembered after all! 5th Dec 2016: \"Dakota Access pipeline: US
  denies key permit, a win for Standing Rock protesters\" https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/04/dakota-access-pipeline-permit-denied-standing-rock?CMP=share_btn_tw

  II, Chair of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe: http://www.democracynow.org/2016/10/17/standing_rock_sioux_tribe_chair_we\n\n\"Obama
  and Native nations have worked hard over eight years to create a special and healthy
  relationship during his tenure. Not a perfect relationship, but definitely special.
  Yet, if he fails to act and kill this Dakota Access Pipeline — a pipeline that directly
  threatens Native treaty rights and also directly threatens Native children’s health
  and well-being — all of that work may be for naught.\" - Gyasi Ross (Blackfeet),
