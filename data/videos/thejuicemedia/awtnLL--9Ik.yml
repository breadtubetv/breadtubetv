title: '''We should be ashamed of ourselves'': Uncle Bob Randall - Part 2 of 2'
description: "'Us old people today should be ashamed of ourselves. I'm sorry, my great,
  great grandchildren: the way things are going I don't think we'll have very much
  to offer you. I apologise for that.'\n\nWe caught up with Uncle Bob in May 2009
  and took the opportunity to ask him 3 questions: \n\n1. Have you seen any improvements
  since the Australian Government's Apology (to the Stolen Generations)?\n2. What
  do yo do to maintain your culture; and how can people become part of indigenous
  culture?\n3. In light of the current crises we face - environmental, financial etc
  - how do you see us progressing into the future?\n4. (bonus question): what role
  can the media play in helping the situation?\n\nFilmed by Sheryl and Felipe of PluginTV
  with TheJuiceMedia. The video is split into two parts for YouTube.\n\nAbout Uncle
  Bob:\n\n[from the Kanyini Website: http://www.kanyini.com/subject.html]:\n\nBob
  Randall was born in 1934 at Middleton Pond on Tempe Station in the Central Desert
  region of the Northern Territory. He is a member of the Yankunytjatjara people and
  one of the listed traditional owners of Uluru. His mother, Tanguawa worked as a
  housemaid at Angus Downs cattle station for Bob's father, station owner, Bill Liddle.
  At a young age, Bob was taken away from his mother under government policy, whom
  he never saw again.\n\nBob: 'I was institutionalised because I didn't wear clothes
  or live in a house. In that natural way of living, there was no need for me to have
  anything other than what I had.'\n\nBob was sent to the Bungalow Telegraph Station
  in Alice Springs, which was the receiving home for Indigenous children from Central
  Australia. Bob: 'They gave me clothes to wear and put me in a house - I didn't like
  it.'\n\nAs a young child, Bob was moved north to the Croker Island Reservation in
  Arnhem Land. He remained at the reservation until he was 20, working at various
  jobs, including as a carpenter, stockman and crocodile hunter. While still a teenager,
  he married Amy, a member of the Amadjera Tribe who had also been stolen from her
  family.\n\nIn the mid-1960s, the family moved to Adelaide, where Bob completed a
  welfare residential worker's course. Bob: 'A lot of our kids were being locked up
  in jail at this stage and I thought I would like to help them.'\n\nIn 1970, Bob
  helped establish the Adelaide Community College for Aboriginal people and lectured
  at the college on Aboriginal cultures. He began to gain recognition for his songwriting
  in the early 1970s, when his song, 'My Brown Skin Baby [They Took Him Away]' caught
  the attention of an ABC journalist, David Roberts. This led to the ground-breaking
  ABC documentary of the same name, which won the Bronze Prize at the Cannes Film
  Festival and focused national and international attention on the issue of separation.
  Bob also appeared in the documentary films Buried Country (produced by Film Australia)
  and Secret Country by John Pilger.\n\nHis work with Aboriginal communities has taken
  many forms. He served as the Director of the Northern Australia Legal Aid Service
  and established Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander centres at the Australian
  National University, University of Canberra and University of Wollongong. He continues
  to present his cultural awareness programs at schools and other institutions and
  in workplaces. His life-long efforts were recognised in 1999 when he was named 'Indigenous
  Person of the Year' at the 1999 National Aboriginal and Islander Day of Celebration
  (NAIDOC) awards.\n\nIn 2004 Bob was inducted in the NT music hall of fame for having
  written such classic songs as Brown Skin Baby and Red Sun, Black Moon about the
  Coniston massacre. Bob is also the author of two books: his autobiography \"Songman\"
  and a children's book 'Tracker Tjginji\" which was part of the 2004 Sydney Writer's
  Festival.\n\nCheck out the trailer for the film Kanyini - well worth a watch!\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvoAE2..."
