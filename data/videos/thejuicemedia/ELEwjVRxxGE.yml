title: 'The Economy: Ron Paul vs Zeitgeist [RAP NEWS 9]'
description: "\"The economy\" threatens to annihilate our stock-piles of imaginary,
  inflated wealth, spawning a battle of epic proportions as insurgent grassroots forces
  move in to #OccupywallStreet and coalitions of indignados hold their ground in Athens,
  Madrid and Tel Aviv; facing up to the riotgear, batons and tazers that stand between
  them and a more equal redistribution of the proverbial pie. ...But enough action
  and excitement! It's time for some heroic armchair philosophy: Join your affable
  host, Robert Foster as he attempts to shine some light on this mysterious creature,
  \"the economy\". Is this the failure of capitalism that we are witnessing, or its
  triumph? Is it the end of the end of history, or yet another crazy chapter in the
  whimsical journey of the human experiment? \n\nPostscript: For the occasion, we've
  pulled out the big guns: admittedly it was a tough choice deciding who to interview:
  we could've had Alan Greenspan on the show, or the Emperor himself, Milton Friedman;
  the first lady, Christine Lagarde; or financial buffs like Gerald Celente, Peter
  Schiff and Donald Trump. But to get the freshest juice we knew we had to go further
  - much further. Rap News 9 features two VIP Internet grandees who have uploaded
  gigabytes of juice via the one remaining free frequency to feed a discerning and
  ravenous audience, thirsty for answers. Whilst these two fine folk agree with each
  other on many things, fortunately, there's no shortage of issues to rap-battle about.
  Well, time's short - so let the rhyme-rodeo begin as we blast off on a rollercoaster
  odyssey. It's the stupid Economy, in all its gory glory.\n\nJuice Rap News: written
  by Giordano Nanni; lyrics and performance by Hugo Farrant. Created by Farrant &
  Nanni in a back-yard studio in suburban Melbourne.\n\n** Free MP3: https://soundcloud.com/juice-rap-news/rn-9-the-economy\nor
