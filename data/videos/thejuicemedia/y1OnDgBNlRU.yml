title: EuroDiVision - feat. Angela Merkel, Slavoj Žižek & IMF [RAP NEWS 31]
description: "We've all heard of EuroVision. But there's another song that’s being
  sung across Europe - the peoples' chants of protest against Europe's austerity measures.
  First we'll hear some of the leading and loudest voices in this competition such
  as Greece, Spain and Ireland, who are fighting back against austerity with people
  power. Then we'll turn to the contest's illustrious judges: Germany's Chancellor
  Angela Merkel, Slovenian philosopher-rockstar Slavoj Žižek, and IMF dminatrix, err...
  director, Christine Lagarde. Join Robert Foster as he examines the Eurozone crisis
  and the causes behind it: Is it all economics and budgets? Is this ideological class
  war? What are the solutions? And what on earth is Australia doing competing in this
  EuroZone song contest? All these questions and more will be tackled as we dive into
  this most bizarre of modern European traditions. Welcome to the EURODIVISION CONTEST.\n\nWritten
