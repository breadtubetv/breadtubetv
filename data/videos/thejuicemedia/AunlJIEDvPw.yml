title: Hazelwood Dark Ages - feat Robbie Thorpe & Scott Ludlam
description: "civil disobedience: 22 people arrested and 500+ protesting at Hazelwood
  in direct action against the dirtiest and most harmful coal-powered station in the
  world. \r\n\r\nHAZELWOOD POWER STATION - is one of the dirtiest power stations in
  the industrialised world, emitting 17megatonnes of CO2 annually. International Power
  Hazelwood employs 520 people.\r\n\r\nHazelwood was scheduled to be decommissioned
  by 2009 due to its excessive carbon dioxide emissions, however the State Government
  in 2005 extended its life until 2031.\r\n\r\nThe action is intended to show that
  the social licence to continue to burn coal and pollute has been revoked. We are
  declaring a Community Decommission Order on Hazelwood, to switch on the renewable
  energy transition.\r\n\r\nSpeakers included: Robbie Thorpe - representative of the
  Gunai/Kurnai - owners of the land in the La Trobe valley, Scott Ludlum, Green Senator
  for WA, and Dave Sweeney, Australian Conservation Foundation, ACF.\r\n\r\nTHE POLICE
  RESPONSE: HOW OUR TAX DOLLARS ARE SPENT. The policing operation was reported to
  have cost in excess of $200,000 with 250 officers present including horses, dogs,
  the helicopter and boats on the pondage. The visible presence was about 100 officers
  along the fence line. Police had constructed a temporary fence about 100 metres
  beyond the real perimeter of the plant. This allowed demonstrators to breach the
  first police line and be arrested without actually getting too close to the plant,
  something the police obviously intended. Police did appear to lose patience by about
  3 PM as the protestors held a final spokes council to decide on how to end the day.
  The meeting was buzzed low by the police helicopter and police liason were told
  that any mass charge on the fence to finish the day would be met with the use of
  capsicum foam. That was their subtle way of saying, it was time to go home.\r\n\r\nArrestees
  were charged with Trespass and were told they will be charged on summons to appear
  in the Morewell Courts at a later date. They were processed on site. One protestor
  was charged with assaulting police after allegedly colliding with a police officer
  after jumping the fence. Organisers have pledged legal support and solidarity fundraising
  will occur for all those arrested.\r\n\r\nWant to know when these events are taking
