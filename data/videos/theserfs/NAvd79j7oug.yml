title: 'Can James Bond Be Black? - Who will be the next James Bond - #jamesbond #007
  #bond #blackbond'
description: "When the requirements to be James Bond are being suave, good looking,
  and British why is it so surprising that it be suggested Idris Elba play the titular
  character? We debunk the theory and history behind it.\n\nCorrection: User Natesh
  Mayuranathan pointed out that Ben Kingsley was in fact half Indian (Gujarati) so
  the accusation of brown face is completely unwarranted. One of the two Serfs who
  run this channel and podcast is Indian himself so he's doubly ashamed. \n\nIf you
