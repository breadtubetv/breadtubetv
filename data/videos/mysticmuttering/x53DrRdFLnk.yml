description: "*CONTENT WARNING VIOLENCE AND ALCOHOL*\n\nI usually try to put those
  in the body of the video - I'm happy to re-edit if it's worth it to y'all. \n\nThis
  one is a secondhand Zen koan that I first heard in a book by the late lamented Robert
  Anton Wilson, whose work can be found here:  http://www.rawilson.com/\n\nAnyone
  curious about how to run a society free from coercion and looking for possible ways,
  means, and analytical tools to get there should check out this playlist: https://youtu.be/HwJBI6lWmpQ\n\nMusic
  is spontaneously composed and original, entitled \"business as usual,\" under a
  share-alike license. Anyone interested in the MP3 should PM me.\n\nI finally have
  a Patreon! Help me make more awesome music and videos here: https://www.patreon.com/mysticmuttering\n\nI
