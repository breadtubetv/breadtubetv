title: Keep On Pushin'
description: "This song is dedicated to everybody who is going to fight for freedom
  in Denver & St. Paul this summer, and to all those who will keep the fight alive
  in their local towns. Also, to Mo, the Fantabulous Four & everybody I met that day
  in Boston for lighting a big ol' fire under my ass.\r\n\r\nThis song was written
  to be very easy to sing in groups, even large ones, because it was inspired by a
  sea shantey. \r\n \r\nIt was written to be easily singable in large groups, one
  person singing the first and third lines, and the whole group joining in on the
  \"Keep on Pushin'\" bits. Example:\r\n\r\nPerson: \"Sisters & brothers in the struggle
  are we\"\r\nGroup: \"Keep on pushin' till a change come around.\"\r\nPerson: \"What
  benefits you will benefit me!\"\r\nGroup: \"Keep on pushin' till a change come around!\"\r\n\r\nAnd
  so on and so forth. Some verses that I left out of this version because I thought
  they did not quite fit with the song's punk aesthetic go like this:\r\n\r\nWhen
  the sky is gray and the end seems nigh\r\n(keep on pushin'. . .)\r\nI'll sing sweet
  songs to keep our spirits high\r\n(keep on pushin'. . .)\r\n\r\nWhen victory comes
  and the sky is blue\r\n(keep on . . .)\r\nI will praise all those who saw it thru\r\n(keep
  on . . .)\r\n\r\nwe don't look like much when we stand alone\r\n(keep on. . .)\r\nbut
  people united can't be overthrown\r\n(keep on. . .)\r\n\r\nWhen corporate giants
  come to our block\r\n(keep on. . .)\r\nWe'll knock them dead with a single rock!\r\n(keep
  on. . .)\r\n\r\n\r\n . . . And for gosh sakes, why stop there? The meter is simple
  enough that any protester worth her/his Food Not Bombs burgoo can come up with still
  more verses. Used intelligently, this song will help hearten any protest group you
  sing it with. \r\n\r\nFootage stolen from documentaries about the N30 protests in
  Seattle & the anti-RNC actions in New York."
