title: A Little Ditty for Election Season
description: "Ever hear a ragtime diss track before? Well. . . here you go.\r\n\r\nLyrics
  \r\n\r\nWell grab your buddies and take a stroll\r\nRight down to the old straw
  poll\r\nIt's election season in Wonderland\r\nWell the Mad Hatter and the March
  Hare \r\nAnd their tea party buddies will all be there\r\nIt's election season in
  wonderland \r\n\r\nThe candidates are lined up on the stage \r\nWhere common sense
  is all the rage \r\nAnd Constitution scholars take their stand \r\nOh vo vodeo \r\nThey
  don't like Commies in the Grand Old Party \r\nJust like in the days of Joe McCarthy
  \r\nIt's election season in Wonderland \r\n Now the Cheshire Cat will moderate \r\nAt
  the beginning of the great debate\r\nIt's election season in Wonderland\r\nHe'll
  sit and smile while they prattle away \r\nAnd bash the Left and the poor and gay\r\nIt's
  election season in Wonderland! \r\n\r\nAmerica, they say, has fallen\r\n'cause Obama's
  worse than ol' Joe Stalin \r\nBut they are ready to lend us all a hand\r\nOh vo
  vodeo\r\nThey'd shift the world right off it's axis \r\nFor deregulation and lower
  taxes \r\nIt's election season in Wonderland \r\n\r\nWell the tea and rhetoric are
  piping hot\r\nThey're giving it everything they've got \r\nIt's election season
  in Wonderland\r\nOn the other side of the looking glass\r\nWhere they ain't afraid
  to talk out their ass\r\nIt's election season in Wonderland\r\n\r\nWatch them scream
  and hoot and holler\r\nAnd worship the Almighty Dollar\r\nBut don't jump on the
  wagon with their band\r\nCast a vote for jobs and schools\r\nNot for those Tea Party
  fools\r\nIt's election season in Wonder-\r\nElection season in Wonder-\r\nElection
  season in Wonderland! \r\n\r\nLicensed under Creative Commons attribution: \r\nCovers,
  remixes, additional lyrics etc Enthusiastically Encouraged!"
