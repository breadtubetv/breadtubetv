title: Playing "Chilly Arms of Ocean" for Alan Doyle
description: This is one of the proudest moments of my life - it's not often you get
  to meet one of your inspirations, let alone play them a song. Thanks to Michael
  Paolucci for telling me about this show and picking up tickets! We had a great time
  at the Alan Doyle show, and afterwards, we made an offering of some rum to the band,
  and I stuck around and relaxed with the band and the last of the audience at the
  bar next door. I mentioned that I was a songwriter and asked Alan Doyle if I could
  sing him something of mine, and when he said "sure!" I ran down the street to grab
  my guitar. I only found this footage recently, but I hope you enjoy!
