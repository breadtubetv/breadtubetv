title: Summer Solstice Blessing
description: "A blessed Solstice to all who watch this! My psychedelic Pagan take
  on “Peace in the Valley,” a good old-timey hymn. May the sun and rain bless your
  fields and all endeavors get good yields, enough to live, enough to spare that never
  need you fret or care. Let us all good neighbors prove, renew in us comradely love.
  Let’s join our souls and hearts and brains to win the world and lose our chains!
