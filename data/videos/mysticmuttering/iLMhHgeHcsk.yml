title: Magickal Yule Jam
description: "When Jesse the Wandering Harper agreed to come to the Yule party at
  Ghost Flower Farm, we knew he would make the night extra magickal. I was just lucky
  to be able to jam with him and doubly lucky that Star got this footage. Sink into
  these meandering melodies and you can practically taste the mulled cider and feel
  the heat of the wood stove. \n\nCheck out more of Jesseâ€™s work here: https://thewanderingharper.bandcamp.com\n\nMerry
  Solstice to all!"
