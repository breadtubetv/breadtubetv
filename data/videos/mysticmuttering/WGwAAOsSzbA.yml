title: The Chilly Arms of Ocean Tiny Desk Concert
description: Here's a better-made attempt at filming my Tiny Desk Contest entry, a
  song written about Sunil "Sunny" Tripathi. Slandered online as a suspect in the
  Boston Marathon Bombing after disappearing from Brown University, his family and
  friends launched a dramatic search for him before he turned up floating in the bay
  off Fox Point. A year afterward, the idea for this song fell into my head one morning,
  I showed it to my band, the King's Busketeers, and it's become a standard of ours.
  Every time we play it, it feels like there's someone right at my elbow, listening.
