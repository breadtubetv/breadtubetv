title: Response to "The Truth about Popular Culture" by PJW
description: "InfoWars' Paul Joseph Watson makes the claim that \"culture used to
  be uplifting,\" and says that the pop music of the last 20 years or so (he's pretty
  vague) represent some dangerous slide into degeneracy. His main examples seem to
  be that people are making careers in pop music making songs about sex, violence,
  drink, and all that other fun stuff. In my response, I use an old murder ballad
  called William Taylor (Roud 158)  to prove that people have sung about those things
  for centuries, and probably always will. Degeneracy is part of my tradition, and
  it's probably part of yours, too.  \n\nThom Avella's wonderful response: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppKTmXHSwio&t=16s\n\nOriginal
