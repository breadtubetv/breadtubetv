title: Victory The Whole World Around!
description: "Happy New Year! Have a song! Sing it in the streets! Sing it to your
  friends! I wish you everything you wish yourself on this happy and auspicious occasion!
  \r\n\r\nWoody Guthrie's New Years' Resolutions: http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2011/12/27/woody-guthrie-1942-resolutions-list/\r\n\r\nLyrics:
  \r\n\r\nWhen a blow is struck somewhere for freedom\r\nWhen the trumpets of uprising
  sound \r\nFrom New York to the streets of Tunisia \r\nIt's a vict'ry the whole world
  around!\r\n\r\nWhen the masses take charge of the masters\r\nWhen their unabashed
  voices resound\r\nWhen compassion replaces oppression\r\nIt's a vict'ry the whole
  world around\r\n\r\nAnd we sing ole (ole ole!)! Huzzah and hooray!  (Hooray! Hooray!)\r\nFor
  friends and good fortune we've found! \r\nAnd tomorrow we'll fight (we'll fight!
  We'll fight!) but for tonight let's celebrate\r\nA vict'ry the whole world around!
  \r\n\r\nWhen the centuried silence is broken\r\nWhen a lost cause somehow gets found\r\nWhen
  the plebs make the plutocrats topple\r\nIt's a vict'ry the whole world around!\r\n\r\n
  When a victim turns into a hero\r\nWhen a pundit turns into a clown\r\nWhen a meme
  turns into a movement\r\nIt's a vict'ry the whole world around \r\n\r\nAnd we sing
  . . . . \r\n\r\nIf your moment was not quite newsworthy\r\nDon't beat yourself up
  or down\r\nEven if no one read the story\r\nIt's a victry the whole world around
  \r\n\r\nSo whatever the contribution \r\nYou bring to this old dancing ground\r\nBe
  it large be it small, we will welcome them all!\r\nThey're all vict'ries the whole
  world around! \r\n\r\nAnd we sing . . . .\r\n\r\n\r\n*I am working out the kinks
  in the sound quality. Thanks for understanding!* \r\n\r\nTru3bad0ur's webcam video
