title: The Return of the Tea
description: |-
  A piece of original utopian fiction set on an English country estate and village being run along syndicalist lines. The story takes the form of a diary entry, recounting a momentous day in the life of an unnamed farm worker. Thanks to my comrades for the seed of this idea and the courage to make it a thing. The music is based on Halantow, the Halston May Day carol.
