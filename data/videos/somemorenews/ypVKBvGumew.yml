description: "Some More News presents a special preview of our podcast, Even More
  News with Cody Johnston and Katy Stoll.\n\nIn today's episode, Katy and Cody make
  some corrections, respond to some criticism, and still have time to discuss the
  really good president, the really good things that really good president is doing,
  SCOTUS' ruling on employee-worker arbitration, and Elon Musk's reasons his workers
  haven't unionized (they just don't want to!).\n\nYou can subscribe to the EVEN MORE
