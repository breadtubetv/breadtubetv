title: The Fake Border Crisis, Steve King, and Our Lying, Racist President - SOME
  MORE NEWS
description: "In our first episode back for the new year, we explore the president's
  lies, racism, dumbness, completely fabricated border crisis, and the media's unfortunate
  inability to report on him accurately and effectively. Also, conservative media
  and politicians' possibly purposeful inability to grapple with and acknowledge Steve
  King's lifetime of racist beliefs and ideas. Perhaps these are all related topics.\n\nSupport
