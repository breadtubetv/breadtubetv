  NEWS
description: "In this week's Some More News, we discuss the Kanye West of it all,
  his new BFF Candice Owens, Prager University, their really smart \"professors\"
  Charlie Kirk, Ben Shapiro, Steven Crowder and Dave Rubin, the Koch Brothers and
  how it all ties into the illusion of Free Thought. Basically, it's all horseshit.
