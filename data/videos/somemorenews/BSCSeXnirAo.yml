  News with Cody Johnston and Katy Stoll.\n\nIn today's episode, Cody and Katy discuss
  Ben Shapiro's fans and parenting skills, and the value of comforting your crying
  child by citing a statistic about the percentage of female enrollment in dental
  school in 2014. They also talk about Comey's \"bombshell\" interview, the tragic
  #WeToo life of Charlie Rose, and the potentially irresponsible portrayal of police
  gun use on very good sitcoms that we love, trust us.\n\nYou can subscribe to the
