description: "In this week's Some More News, we plead with Fox News to not fire not
  journalist Sean Hannity for being unethical. In other news, President Donald Trump
  declares war on peace and bombs the hell out of Syria for... reasons. In other news,
  Paul Ryan retires and dedicates his life to finding his smile. \n\nSupport SOME
