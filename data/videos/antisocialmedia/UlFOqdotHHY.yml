  YouTube is demonetizing videos which feature offensive content. People like Sargon can't say horrible things anymore to idiots for money. This makes Sargon sad.

  Subscribing and liking videos is great, but if you want to go one stage further you can give me a whopping $1.00 a month via Patreon (that's around £7 per year). I will invest in recording equipment (decent camera, editing programmes, pop-shield for the mic, etc) with your donations. I am not here to make a profit.

  I repeat: THIS IS A NON-PROFIT PATREON.

  Thanks for watching. x
