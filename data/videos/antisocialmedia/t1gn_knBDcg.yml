title: AIU Doesn't Understand Star Wars
description: |-
  YouTuber 'Atheism Is Unstoppable', aka 'AIU', aka 'Devon Racey' doesn't understand how Star Wars works.

  Neither do his fans.

  Rogue Won (lol) was a great success, despite their best efforts. Here I look at how Star Wars haters got it wrong.
