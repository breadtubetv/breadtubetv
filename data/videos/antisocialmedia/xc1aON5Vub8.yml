  PJW attacks comedian Josie Long because she's worried about far-right terrorism, but PJW looks a fool because he's wrong about EVERYTHING.

  Despite my best efforts, this video does contain a few seconds of copyrighted music, therefore YouTube refuses to monetise it. I'm gutted I can't earn a whopping $3-$5 dollars for 5 days worth of work.
  So if you liked the video feel free to send me a similar amount via paypal, or set up a monthly payment with Patreon. I AM SO VERY POOR.
