title: 10 Reasons Why Milo (@Nero) SHOULDN'T Be Twitter CEO
description: |-
  Milo Yiannopolous (@Nero) is one of a handful of very popular professional Trolls. He uses offensive comments and extreme views to gain attention (mostly negative) and to make a living. He is very successful at it, but that doesn't mean he's immune to a mocking on Youtube.

  This video is based around his ridiculous article '10 Things I'd Do As Twitter CEO'.
