  CONGRATULATIONS to comedian Bilal Zafar, who today was nominated as BEST NEWCOMER at the Edinburgh Fringe.

  Bilal starred in an early podcast episode where he discussed how he was abused online, how he took that abuse and turned it into comedy, won awards, and turned it all into the Edinburgh show.

  =====================

  Bilal's Edinburgh show: https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/bilal-zafar-cakes

  It's a free show but it costs only £4 to reserve tickets, which I highly recommend after the nomination.

  Subscribing and liking videos is great, but if you want to go one stage further you can give me a whopping $1.00 a month via Patreon (that's around £7 per year). I will invest in recording equipment (decent camera, editing programmes, pop-shield for the mic, etc) with your donations. I am not here to make a profit.

  I repeat: THIS IS A NON-PROFIT PATREON.

  Thanks for watching. x
