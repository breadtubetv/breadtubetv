title: Response to Prager U [Owen Benjamin] - 'The Strange Death Of Comedy'
description: "Right-Wingers Don't Understand Comedy, part 1.\n\nIn this new video
  series I explore the right and far-right's inability to be funny, and misunderstand
  how comedy works.\n\nPart 1 is a response to Owen Benjamin's video for the propaganda
  network 'Prager U'. His video is called 'The Strange Death Of Comedy'. Needless
  to say - Comedy is alive and well.\n\n=====\n\nANTI-SOCIAL MEDIA on Twitter: https://twitter.com/ASM_AntiSocial\n\nListen/watch
