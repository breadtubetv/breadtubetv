title: WTF is the Alt Right?
description: |-
  Hillary Clinton mentioned them, and their mascot, Pepe the Frog is now officially a hate symbol, but what IS the Alt-Right, what do they do, and who do they hate?

  Update, May 2018 - This was a very early video by me, and it is still very funny and informative in places, however there are a few mistakes and glaring errors too. Please bear that in mind when watching, thanks. x

  Subscribing and liking videos is great, but if you want to go one stage further you can give me a whopping $1.00 a month via Patreon (that's around £7 per year). I will invest in recording equipment (decent camera, editing programmes, pop-shield for the mic, etc) with your donations. I am not here to make a profit.

  I repeat: THIS IS A NON-PROFIT PATREON.

  Thanks for watching. x
