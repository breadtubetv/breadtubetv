description: "★THIS WEEK: \"Viral NRA Ad\" -  Yeah, an ad that says: “they use their
  media to assassinate real news,” the woman’s voice says scornfully. “They use their
  schools to teach children that their president is another Hitler. They use their
  movie stars and singers and comedy shows and award shows to repeat their narrative
  over and over again.” Also, it's for guns.\n\n ★It's not JUST a commercial! NEW

  takes on a violent NRA commercial. The nra ad featuring dana loesch is absolutely
  undefendable. The nra and dana loesch nra take the Gun Debate to a new height, basically
  attempting to incite a civil war. An nra civil war would be very bad. The violence
  of lies National Rifle Association video. This nra video, basically a dana loesch
  nra ad 2017 doesn't even talk about Gun Control. The dana loesch nra ad looks to
  just be inciting violence. There's been a lot of dana loesch gun control content,
  but nothing as scary as this viral nra ad, called Freedom's Safest Place: The Violence
  Of Lies. This kind of NRA PSA has no place in society.\n\nHelp us caption & translate
