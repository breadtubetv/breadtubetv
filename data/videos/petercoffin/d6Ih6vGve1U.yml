  http://petercoff.in\n\n**********************\n\nLAST NIGHTLY takes on president
  trump liberty commencement, saying \"we dont worship government we worship god.\"
  Which is ridiculous. President Trump liberty speech is not a good time. I mean,
  the trump iberty commencement or the president trump liberty commencement speech,
  is not something that should go like that. Trump at liberty university was a disaster.
  ‘We don’t worship government we worship god’, are you kidding? Trump tells liberty
  graduates to challenge elites critics, and then basically tells them anyone who
  \"worship government,\" should be in trouble? \"We worship god.\" Sure. This trump
  speech is no good. Not acceptable.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/daG0/\n\n-~-~~-~~~-~~-~-\nNEW
