  on the delay of the senate health bill. Will they repeal and replace? Donald Trump's
  senate health care bill is not the health care bill we should pass. The health care
  reform we need is #MedicareForAll. mitch mcconell totally disagrees. But don't believe
  \"senate gop health bill on brink of defeat.\" Yes, the senate health bill reels
  as cbo predicts 22 million more uninsured but the senate health bill committee is
  still moving forward on the senate health bill 2017. The house bill worked the same
  way, they didn't do the senate health bill vote. Hopefully this isn't what ends
  up being the us senate health bill. Delaying the senate vote on health care bill
  might be positive, but they could move forward on the senate reconciliation health
  care bill. Here's more info on the current health care bills in senate.\n\nHelp
