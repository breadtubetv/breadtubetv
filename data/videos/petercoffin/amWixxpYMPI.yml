  #welcometohell, the hamburg g20 protests. The g20 summit caused a number of hamburg
  riots after a g20 protest with some antifa went wrong. Police caused the protest
  g20 to go worse than expected, the anti trump antifa clash with police, causing
  an anti g20 protest to go badly. It's not necessarily that people are anti g20,
  but many are angry Trump pulled the US out of the Paris climate accord. The protest
  at g20 was a leftist protest at g20 and the antifa protest at g20 was quite a bit
  of an anti-capatalist demonstration. Many watched the g20 protest live, but the
  anti g20 summit was a protest germany movement that didn't go well. The g20 protest
  2017 aka the g20 protests happened in hamburg live. The riots g20 were a big surprise,
  but the g20 hamburg police g20 resulted in hamburg riots 2017.\n\nHelp us caption
