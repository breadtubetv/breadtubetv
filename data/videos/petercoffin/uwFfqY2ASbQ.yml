  http://petercoff.in\n\n*************************\n\nLAST NIGHTLY coveres the Charleena
  Lyles shooting. A pregnant woman shot by police, yes the woman shot armed with knife
  but the main important thing is that pregnant mother killed by the police. In no
  way did she deserve to die, the Charleena Lyles police shooting was totally without
  merit and should never have happened. This is the recently police shooting in seattle,
  the seattle police department was involved in the Charleena Lyles shooting. A statement
  from the seattle police department of justice says that the police were armed with
  non lethal weapons and should have deployed those against a relatively small person
  wielding a small weapon and possibly not actually even doing anything. It's a shame
  there even has to be social justice news - there should already be social justice.
  A mother with mental illness killed by the police is not something you hear in a
  country that acts responsably. A pregnant mother killed by seattle police should
  be morally despicable to you. Any pregnant woman killed by seattle police, regardless
  of what they were doing, should be under particular scrutiny and the seattle police
  need to answer for the Charleena Lyles shooting.\n\nHelp us caption & translate
