title: Senate Healthcare Bill Defeated? (LAST NIGHTLY №54)
description: "Repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act -- the hot button and
  emotionally-charged issue that sharply split his party -- proved to be too difficult
  a task for now, something McConnell acknowledged at a crowded Capitol news conference
  where he was asked bluntly if his \"leadership\" had been \"damaged\" by the process.

  http://petercoff.in\n\n******************************\n\nLAST NIGHTLY takes on Donald
  Trump and Mitch McConnell's continuead Health Insurance debacle, but is it a senate
  healthcare defeat? The senate gop health care bill has not been going well and Trump
  calls on senate to end filibuster after healthcare defeat. The senate healthcare
  bill, which is not the american health care act, is being called dead. But the fact
  is, they don't mess around. They act as if it's over so you stop paying attention.
  Sanders gop health care plan comments are basically that the sanders health care
  act, or Medicare for All, would be better. But bernie sander helath care act has
  a long way to go and this bad senate health care bill, the republican health care
  bill, a secretive health care bill is still around. If we ever want single payer
  we are going to have to keep pushing. Single payer health care is the only moral
  way; and a single payer system should be what we do. The single payer debate is
  over, those for have won. Now we just need to force the government to follow us.\n\nHelp
