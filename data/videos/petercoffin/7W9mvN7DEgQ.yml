title: The Senate Healthcare Bill (LAST NIGHTLY №48)
description: "Senate Republicans crafted their Senate healthcare bill behind closed
  doors, drawing considerably less news attention than House Republicans, who formally
  drafted their version of the legislation in open sessions. But Democrats believe
  the coming week represents their best and perhaps final chance to thwart repeal
  of the health law. What are the differences between the House and Senate health
  care bills? \U0001F4A5BECOME A PATRON at http://patreon.com/petercoffin\n \n*****************************************\nYou've

  http://petercoff.in\n\n***************************\n\nLAST NIGHTLY takes on the
  senate health care bill to repeal the affordable care act. The Senate's version
  of the American Health Care Act is here, as introduced by Mitch McConnell. The gop
  health care bill was ghastly in the house and is garbage as the senate healthcare
  bill, too. Hopefully people don't even remember the senate health care bill 2017,
  but we now know both the house and senate health care bills. Last Nightly attempts
  to show some differences between house and senate health care bills, but keep in
  mind they are pretty similar if you've seen the senate healthcare bill text. The
  senate healthcare bill name basically doesn't matter, the senate healthcare bill
  2017 should just be called the senate healthcare bill vote. The senate healthcare
  bill timeline seems pretty short, as the CBO will score it over the weekend. The
  senate healthcare bill committee gave the senate healthcare bill summary on Friday.\n\nHelp
