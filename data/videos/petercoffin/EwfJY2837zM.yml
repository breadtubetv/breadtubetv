description: "As Charlottesville begins to heal after this weekend's violence, many
  are wondering how things got out of hand so quickly. One group that didn't do enough
  to prevent the violence as the crowds grew and tensions flared: the police.  \U0001F4A5BECOME

  the right, the racist violence in charlottesville. There was a white nationalist
  charlottesville rally called #unitetheright where the alternative right, or the
  far right, or really just hate groups, had a hate march. It was pure white nationalism
  on display, with white nationalist celebs like richard spencer charlottesville.
  People thought he was arrested in the charottesville violence based on a photo he
  was seen in, but unfortunately no. The racism of the traditionalist worker party
  and other white supremacists like nazis was on display in charlottesville.\n\nHelp
