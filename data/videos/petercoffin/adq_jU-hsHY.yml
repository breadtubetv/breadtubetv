title: '#CNNBlackmail (LAST NIGHTLY №50)'
description: "A wrestling GIF posted to Reddit last week by an alt-right troll has
  become the focal point of mounting tensions between the president, the media, and
  internet-bred ideological extremism, which have since prompted the trending hashtag
  #CNNBlackmail and escalating right-wing backlash against CNN. \U0001F4A5BECOME A

  #cnnblackmail, an issue brought on by CNN journalist Andrew Kaczynski. There's been
  a large amount of  controversy over an alleged public CNN blackmail. Regardless
  of what \"hana**holesolo\" does on his time, the thing that got him in trouble was
  posting wrestling CNN memes. If we are talking about doxxing, the threat of CNN
  doxxing a private citizen should be taken a lot more seriously than it is. CNN doxing,
  or even threatening doxing, of someone specifically for making a meme about them
  is a serious, serious problem. No, the CNN Trump meme isn't good. No, I don't like
  the CNN trump gif, but what is happening does kind of feel like CNN black mail against
  someone.The Reddit Trump wrestling video, as some know it, is a gif of Trump wrestling
  CNN, obviously it's fake. The #cnnblackmail twitter outrage seems to entirely disregard
  that if this was flipped partisan-wise, people would have a lot more trouble with
  CNN doxxing 15 year old. Frankly, we should not live in a timeline where CNN threatens
  to dox private citizen. CNN should be talking about how DONALD TRUMP repurposed
  a stupid CNN Trump meme into state propaganda, but the CNN Trump wrestling meme
  seems to mainly just being used by them to punish someone.\n\nHelp us caption &
