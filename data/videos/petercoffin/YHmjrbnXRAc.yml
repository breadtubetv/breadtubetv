  takes on this weird Match.com Father's Day Lots of Questions commercial. Weirdly,
  match.com lots of questions is match.com father's day commercial for 2017. No match.com
  commercial has ever really been particularl interesting, and this match.com commercial
  2017 isn't changing that. There were no match.com commercial 2016 that did it either,
  but this match.com commercial girl shows up in relation to a weird thing a kid does
  for Father's day. The match.com commercial girl with accent isn't anywhere to be
  seen, but the match.com commercial guy annoying is absolutely true. The guy in this
  match com commercial is terrible at handling a household so GUESS WHAT THEY HAVE
  HIM DO. The match.com commercial 2015 we don't even remember, so don't even bother
  asking about match.com commercial 2014. This one doesn't have a match.com commercial
  song, but it's at least a little less obvious than match.com commercial first date.\n\nHelp
