  takes on the idea that if you advocate for socialism or criticize capitalism iphone
  is off limits. Obviously there's a big capitalism iphone meme and even a capitalism
  iphone game. You always see the resist capitalism iphone cases, but there's probably
  a custom anti capitalist iphone itself here in neoliberalism. It is good to resist
  capitalism, even with a resist capitalism iphone case that was made in capitalism
  and corporatism. Yes, capitalism made your iphone. Yes, capitalism is waiting in
  line for an iphone, but there's plenty of capitalist breadlines earlier; it's not
  just leftism or socialism. Both the left and right have had examples. Standing in
  line for bread also makes a lot more sense than waiting for an iphone. You should
  resist capitalism and corporatism, become anti-capitalism. The term \"sjw\" is stupid.
  \"Anti-capitalist\" is better lol. Bernie Sanders is right about the free market.
  Sometime Slavoj Zizek is right, too. Neoliberalism doesn't work; Nancy Pelosi is
  wrong and corporatism is BS. We need leftist progressivism and marxism. Anticapitalism
  makes more sense. Get money out of politics now or later stuff will get even more
  dire.\n\n*****************\n\n#Apple #iPhoneXs #XsMax\n\n-~-~~-~~~-~~-~-\nNEW VIDEO:
