title: "Women and Lobsters: Stereotypes and Archetypes - Eliot Rosenstock on Jordan Peterson at #JPCON"

  Eliot Rosenstock, AMFT Psychotherapist The notion of a collective unconscious is appealing because it is something that appeals to our wish for some sort of unity, or oneness.
  <br/><br/>
  Populism and mutually known stereotypes can be conjured up to form this oneness! A conference why these populist notions are bad, a Peterson video about why they are the scientific truth, the key thing here is we all *know* the populist notions of womanhood, and dominance. So tales of lobsters don't go over anyone's head, agreeing or disagreeing.
