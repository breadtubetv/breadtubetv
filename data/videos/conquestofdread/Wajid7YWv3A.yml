title: WHY AQUAMAN SUCKS (The Commodification of the Polynesian Body) - Conquest of
  Dread
description: "Haha I tricked you into thinking I was gonna talk about the wet man
  but now you're here you have to listen to my primer on all the ways outsiders have
  profited off of the bodies of Pacific people ahaha please don't close the tab, I
  need your engagement!!!!!\n\n\U0001F6ABCONTENT WARNING\U0001F6AB\nThere's a little
  bit of gross stuff in there in regards to early Europeans taking advantage of Pacific
  Islanders, it's clearly marked though so you'll have the opportunity to skip past
  it if you need to!\n\n The book I referenced is Michael Sturma's \"South Sea Maidens:
  Western Fantasy and Sexual Politics in the South\", so if you want to get really
  mad then check it out! Plus there are also some excerpts from \" Inglorious Dastards:
  Rangiaowhia raid and the 'great war for New Zealand'\" by Vincent O'Malley.\n\nExtra

  film festival are putting on a 2 week expo of indigenous games, animation, VR and
  all kinds of good stuff!!!\nhttps://maorilandfilm.co.nz/rangatahi/match/\n\nRead
  this excellent article and watch the video linked inside:\nhttps://thespinoff.co.nz/atea/19-12-2018/once-were-gardeners-lovers-and-poets-not-warriors/\n\nAnd
