title: Noam Chomsky (1978) - "The Secular Priesthood" Glitch Mix
description: "Noam Chomsky on American Exceptionalism and Propaganda, featuring a
  modification of a set submitted by Tryptophant to Shankra Festival 2018.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTwo
  uploads in one week! I had planned to start getting on a regular (perhaps weekly)
  upload schedule, but I will be visiting a monastery for the weekend and will probably
  be technology free during that time. I decided to finish and release this mix early
  rather than late. Anyway I hope you enjoy, I will be working on a Thomas Merton
  mix as I have time so expect that in about a week and a half. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAudio
