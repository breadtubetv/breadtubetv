  all! I hope you enjoy some more Murray Bookchin this week. Drum & Bass is one of
  my favorite genres but due to the heavy use of vocals, I often can't use D&B for
  my lecture mixes. For some great D&B, check out Bjorn's playlist:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLt7CvagyYYo5dAabzCC1QYGTw_76VOX7Y\n\nI
  picked up a second job today. I hope this doesn't decrease my upload frequency,
  but due to the nature of decreasing my time it very well may. Thank you all for
  listening and I look forward to making more :)\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAudio
