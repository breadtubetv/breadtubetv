title: Thomas Merton (1960s) - "The Deinstitutionalization of the Church" Chill Trap/Bass
  Mix
description: "Thomas Merton on the Church as Institution, featuring a short Chill
  Trap/Bass mix by Aphreditto\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nShort
  lecture this week. I hope you enjoy this section of an AMA Thomas Merton did with
  an order of nuns. I'm not sure what will be coming next. I'm hoping to do a pacifist
  reading soon from Simone Weil, but I also want to do a mix with a reading of Abdullah
  Ã–calan's Democratic Confederalism. I will be traveling this week so I will have
  time to plan out the next few mixes. In the meantime though, let me know if you
  enjoyed Merton.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAudio
