title: Yanis Varoufakis (2015) "The Flower of Democracy" - Psybass Mix
description: "Yanis Varoufakis on the EU, Democracy, Capitalism, and Bankroptocracy,
  featuring a Psybass mix by Tryptophant. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA
  bit of a different perspective this week. I feel that Varoufakis's perspective on
  the state of the world economy is very apt. I have also been working on a Noam Chomsky
  mix on the subject of Turkish state terror, but the task of making Chomsky's voice
  audible to the human ear has been mind boggling. I know not what sorcery to use.
  Anyway, enjoy this week's mix and have a nice week, lovlies.\n \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAudio
