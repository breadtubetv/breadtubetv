title: Selling Extinction
description: "Selling Extinction is a short introduction to the capitalist notion
  of a \"Green New Deal\", the NGOs that support it and the recent Extinction Rebellion
  protests in London.\n\n#SocialismorExtinction\n\nSupport us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/prolekult\n\nTwitter:

  recommend our viewers look into some of the excellent work that has already been
  produced on the Green New Deal. Cory Morningstar's series on the NGO push for the
  financialisation of nature is a very thorough starting point. \n\nhttp://www.wrongkindofgreen.org/2019/01/17/the-manufacturing-of-greta-thunberg-for-consent-the-political-economy-of-the-non-profit-industrial-complex/\n\nWe
  would also recommend checking of the recently founded Green Anti-Capitalist Front
  and their upcoming events. Their manifesto is an important development and demonstrates
  the real potential of building a movement against imperialism's destruction of the
  earth. \n\nhttps://greenanticapitalist.org/"
