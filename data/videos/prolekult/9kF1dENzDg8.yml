title: 'History is Marching | Part one: Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism'
description: "History is Marching is a feature length documentary analyzing the rise
  in tensions between major world powers of the course of 2018. \n\nThis section of
  the film looks at Karl Marx's critique of capitalist political economy and crisis,
  and Lenin's work in advancing this critique in 1916, with the emergence of capitalist
  imperialism. These same fundamental economic structures guide our world today. Marxism
  allows us to understand how they function and shape the political world.\n\nPlease
