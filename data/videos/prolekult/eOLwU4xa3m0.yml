title: 'History is Marching | Part two: the Post-War Boom, "Globalisation" and Great
  Power Competition'
description: "History is Marching is a feature length documentary analyzing the rise
  in tensions between major world powers of the course of 2018. \n\nThe second part
  of the film looks at economic and political history between 1945 and early 2018
  to establish how capitalism has developed following the world wars. With the US
  now dominant in the world economy, the historically unique period of the post-war
  boom (1945-1973) saw the formation of a strong alliance between western nations.
  This subsisted, despite a return to economic crisis in the major capitalist economies
  in 1973-1974, through what is known as neoliberal \"globalisation\" by academics.
  This period has now come to a close, with the economic end of \"globalisation\"
  in 2016 and a military expression of this fact in early 2018, with the US' National
  Defence Strategy describing the period as one of great power competition.\n\nPlease
