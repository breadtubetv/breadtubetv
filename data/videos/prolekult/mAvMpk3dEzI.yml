title: Rivers of Chaos
description: "Rivers of Chaos is a short film poem written to protest Donald Trump's
  visit to imperialist Britain, beginning 12 July 2018. Today, imperialism stands
  as an existential threat to the human species. The capitalist crisis is leading
  to imperialist power competition - that is, a complete crisis of human civilisation.
  It must be resisted.\n\nTrump is a symptom.\nImperialist capitalism is the disease.\nSocialism
  or barbarism?\n\nPlease consider supporting our work on Patreon: https://patreon.com/prolekult\n\nIf
