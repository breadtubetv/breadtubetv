title: 'History is Marching | Part seven: Socialism and War'
description: "History is Marching is a feature length documentary analyzing the rise
  in tensions between major world powers of the course of 2018. \n\nThis part of the
  film ties together the analysis developed in previous parts to understand Trump's
  withdrawal from the Intermediate Nuclear-Forces Treaty, and France and Germany's
  call for an independent European Army in November 2018. It argues that economic
  conditions today are clearly leading the world's major powers into open confrontation.
  That this could spiral into a third world war is already being treated as a living
  element of US military policy and strategy. In seeing this, we must understand that
  there can be only one response: socialism.\n\nPlease consider supporting our work
