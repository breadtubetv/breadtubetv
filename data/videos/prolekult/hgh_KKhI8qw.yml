title: 'A Dying Culture | Part six: A Famine of Abundance'
description: "A Dying Culture is a feature length Marxist-Leninist documentary, looking
  at art, culture, the state, postmodernism, video games, social media, war and crisis.
  \n\nThis part of the film looks at the crisis today faced by imperialist society
  - that is, its final crisis. After briefly outlining this, it goes on to argue that
  this signifies the end of the material basis necessary for postmodern hegemony,
  and is leading to ideological crisis.\n\nSupport us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/prolekult\nFollow
