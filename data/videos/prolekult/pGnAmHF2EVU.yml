title: Hands off Venezuela
description: |-
  On 23 January, 2019, Juan Guaid√≥ declared himself President of Venezuela. He was immediately recognized as such by the US. This is a coup, now backed not just by the US, but by Canada and Europe. The US is attempting to destroy the Bolivarian revolution and the gains made for the Venezuelan working class, in order to subject Venezuela to merciless exploitation.

  Imperialist hands off Venezuela!
