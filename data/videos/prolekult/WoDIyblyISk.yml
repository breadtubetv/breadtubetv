title: Pride is Resistance
description: "Solidarity for #PrideMonth!\n\nThe history of LGBTQ+ liberation movements
  under capitalist imperialism is inextricably linked to the history of the socialist
  movement and class struggle. Both the first and second LGBTQ+ movements in the imperialist
  nations were led by socialists and working class activists. \n\nToday, on the precipice
  of the largest crisis in imperialism's history, the victories won by these struggles
  are at risk of being destroyed and the conditions facing working class LGBTQ+ people
  are still utterly intolerable. Whilst capitalism is clearly capable at mediating
  homophobic, biphobic and transphobic oppression for those within the bourgeoisie,
  it cannot resolve this oppression.\n\nFurther reading on LGBTQ+ liberation and socialist
