description: "A Dying Culture is a feature length Marxist-Leninist documentary, looking
  at art, culture, the state, postmodernism, video games, social media, war and crisis.
  \n\nThis part of the film gives an historical account of postmodernism's emergence,
  beginning with the rise of the modernist art movements in the mid 1800s and concluding
  with the postmodern rejection of history in the 1990s. It traces postmodernism's
  ideological development through multiple trends, including philosophy, economics,
  politics and state intervention.\n\nSupport us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/prolekult\nFollow
