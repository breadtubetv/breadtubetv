title: 'A Dying Culture | Part eleven: Pandora''s Loot Box'
description: "A Dying Culture is a feature length Marxist-Leninist documentary, looking
  at art, culture, the state, postmodernism, video games, social media, war and crisis.
  \n\nThis part of the film looks at the phenomenon of loot boxes as an imposed artificial
  scarcity, brought about by a crisis of profitability in the video game industry.
  It argues that capitalism necessarily must impose this scarcity to produce video
  games in the face of this crisis.\n\nSupport us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/prolekult\nFollow
