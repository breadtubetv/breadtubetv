title: 'History is Marching | Part four: A European Twilight'
description: "History is Marching is a feature length documentary analyzing the rise
  in tensions between major world powers of the course of 2018. \n\nThis part of the
  film looks at developments in the European Union since Trump began to assert the
  US' interests in Europe a more concerted way in mid-2018. It traces the intent of
  a faction of the European Commission, led by Germany and France, to consolidate
  the EU as a bloc capable of competing with the US. This process is fraught with
  difficulties and political barriers, largely owing to the EU's nature as an alliance
  of disparate interests.\n\nPlease consider supporting our work on Patreon: https://patreon.com/prolekult\n\nIf
