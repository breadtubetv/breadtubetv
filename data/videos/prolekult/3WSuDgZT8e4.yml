title: 'May Day: we are the solution'
description: "May Day is international workers day. In this short video, we extend
  our solidarity to revolutionary forces fighting imperialism across the globe and
  quickly outline Marxism as the only force which has shown itself capable of defeating
  imperialist barbarism. With the world today faced by two extinction threats in the
  form of the environmental crisis and the threat of world war (\"great power competition\"),
  the cause of Marxism has never been more urgent.\n\nWe are the solution.\n#SocialismorExtinction\n\nSupport
