title: Before the Grave of Humanity
description: "Before the Grave of Humanity is a film poem written against the Turkish
  advance into Syria, beginning with the announcement of \"Operation Peace Spring\"
  on 9 October 2019. At time of publication, the Turkish advance is ongoing, ISIS
  combatants are again in play and Turkish military have US nuclear resources surrounded.
  The dark torrent of violence unleashed in Syria by US imperialism and its \"allies\"
  in Europe (principally Britain) repeated and continued meddling in the Middle-East
  now casts a shadow over the whole globe.\n\n\n\n\n#SocialismorExtinction\n#HandsOffSyria\n\nSupport
