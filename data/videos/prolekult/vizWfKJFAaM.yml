title: 'A Dying Culture | Part fifteen: The Prince of Chaos'
description: "A Dying Culture is a feature length Marxist-Leninist documentary, looking
  at art, culture, the state, postmodernism, video games, social media, war and crisis.
  \n\nThis part of the film looks at the political style of Donald Trump - the first
  authentic \"social media\" politician in the West - as a symptom of an historical
  age of farce. This section also considers postmodern fascism as a political phenomenon
  and contains images any human being should rightly find distressing.\n\nSupport
