  I had to do a voice-over in the video when I said "Simulacra and Simulation" and it sounds strange and out-of-place, but actually fits with the theme because it highlights the unreality of what you're watching.

  Also I goddamn said that Bateman records a voice message on Allen's phone, when it was clearly a tape recorder. I bet people will point that out in the comments.

  Recommended introductory reading on Baudrillard:
  "Jean Baudrillard" by Douglas Kellner in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy - https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/baudrillard/
  "Jean Baudrillard: From Marxism to Postmodernism and Beyond" by Douglas Kellner - https://pages.gseis.ucla.edu/faculty/kellner/Baudrillard.pdf

  I quoted Baudrillard from
  "The System of Objects" page 15 - https://monoskop.org/images/2/28/Baudrillard_Jean_The_system_of_objects_1996.pdf
  "America" pages 32-33 in the pdf - https://monoskop.org/images/a/ac/Baudrillard_Jean_America_1989.pdf
