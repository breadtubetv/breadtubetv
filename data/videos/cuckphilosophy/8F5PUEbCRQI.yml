  Disclaimer: I know “postmodern” is often an unhelpful term and Derrida himself never labeled himself or his work “postmodern”. Even just labeling the analysis "post-structuralist” would’ve been better in terms of accuracy, but all I wanted is a catchy title. (Also maybe the title will get me more views because of the commotion about postmodernism that Jordan Peterson caused.)
