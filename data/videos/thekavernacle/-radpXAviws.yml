title: "DEBUNKING Alt-Right Myths about the First Crusade"
channel: thekavernacle
description: "The alt-right and general conservatives like to paint the First Crusade as a defence of Christendom after sustained Muslim attack since the Islamic Empire spread to Iberia in 711 and was finally halted in Tours, France in 732. I debunk these myths and give the topic the nuance it requires."
