description: "http://patreon.com/anactualjoke\nhttp://twitter.com/anactualjoke\n\nStated
  Purpose:\nIn this essay I would like to discuss and dissect the role of women within
  the Alt-Right which aligns with the historical role white women have played within
  white supremacist movements, along with the differences between the visibility of
  women today and the women of the past in these movements.\n\nSources & For Further
