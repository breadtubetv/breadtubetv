description: "In this video, weâ€™re discussing the merits of three different approaches
  to liberation politics.  Liberal IDPOL, Class Reductionism, and Intersectional Socialism.
  I hope y'all enjoy this video. I worked hard on it. \n\nThe sound effects are inconsistent,
  because I wanted to put this out now.\n\nNext one is way shorter, and is almost
  done. It's one from an archive that I'm gonna release, and the video after that
  is almost done script writing.\nOh yeah, I wrote this with Ameera W. | FKA Squid
  Kid\nI mentioned some articles, but I only remembered to grab this link. Transcript
  and other articles coming soon.\nhttp://blackyouthproject.com/yes-black-people-commodify-black-lives-matter-too-and-its-a-major-problem/\nPlease
