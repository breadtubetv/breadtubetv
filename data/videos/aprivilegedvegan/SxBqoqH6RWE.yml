title: How Ableism Hurts Animals
description: |-
  In this video, I look at some of the ways that ableism hurts animals. This is the first video in my series “Systems of Speciesism”, where I’ll be exploring various ways in which animals are negatively affected by our systems of power.

  To leave you with another killer quote by Sunaura Taylor: "Ableist values are central to animal industries, where the dependency, vulnerability, and presumed lack of emotional awareness or intellectual capacity of animals creates the groundwork for a system that makes billions of dollars in profit each year. The very norms and institutions that perpetuate animal suffering and exploitation are supported by ableism” (59)
