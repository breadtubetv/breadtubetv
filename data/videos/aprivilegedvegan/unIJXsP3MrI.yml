description: "This video is a response video to Stef Sanjati's video \"Why I'm Not
  Vegan (and why I'm going to try)\". It is mostly a big list of all the trans/ queer
  trans vegans that are doing incredible work in the movement, working hard to connect
  animal liberation and queer liberation to end oppression. \n\nStef’s video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLHV7s1sSxA\n\nCalvin
