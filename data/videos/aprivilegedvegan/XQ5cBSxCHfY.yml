title: Neoliberalism has brainwashed how we see ourselves
description: "Under neoliberalism, we are all just bits of capital trying to increase
  our market value. RESIST!!!!\n\nFollow me on Facebook! https://www.facebook.com/aprivilegedvegan/?ref=bookmarks\n\n“Rather
  than a creature of power and interest, the self becomes capital to be invested in,
  enhanced according to specified criteria and norms as well as available inputs [...]
  no longer are citizens most importantly constituent elements of sovereignty, members
  of publics, or ever bearers of rights. Rather, as human capital, they may contribute
  or be a drag on economic growth; they may be invested in or divested from depending
  on their potential for GDP enhancement” Wendy Brown, \"Undoing the Demos: Liberalism’s
  Stealth Revolution\" \n\nLinks to related sources:\n\nUndoing the Demos: Neoliberalism's
