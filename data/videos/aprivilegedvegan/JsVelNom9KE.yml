title: Will we see a vegan world under capitalism? (Vegfest Talk)
description: "Hey Everyone!\nThis is the speech that I gave at Vegfest London (October
  2017). In this talk, I try to make sense of the fact that veganism is growing, and
  still, more animals are being killed. \nHere is a breakdown of the talk: \n0:48
  What does the news tell us? How can two opposing industries be profitable at the
  same time? \n7:20 Three ways the meat industry uses to stay profitable even with
  a stagnating meat/ dairy consumption and a growing vegan market in industrialized
  nations\n13:24 How capitalism can use vegan consumerism as a way to survive and
  thrive\n18:05 How has neoliberal citizenship changed us?\n21:55 How is capitalist
  veganism limiting animal rights activists (personal story)\n27:14 Final thoughts:
  using the “de-commodification of life” as a principle to ally all social justice
  movements\n\nFollow me on Facebook! https://www.facebook.com/aprivilegedvegan/ \n\nThanks
