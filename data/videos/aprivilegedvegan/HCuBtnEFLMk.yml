title: GOING VEGAN WITH AN EATING DISORDER? (ft. Nichole)
description: "Going vegan can present notable challenges for someone suffering from
  disordered eating. Today I ask Nichole about her personal experience, as well as
  what triggers someone can expect when going vegan. We also talk about the fallacy
  that a plant-based diet is a universal cure for health and thinness. Finally, Nichole
  shares her advice :) \n\nCheck out the Vegan Warrior Princesses Attack Podast: veganwarriorprincessesattack.com\n\nWatch
