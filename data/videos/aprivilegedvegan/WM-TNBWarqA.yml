title: THE FLINT WATER CRISIS and ENVIRONMENTAL RACISM
description: "In this video I talk about the flint water crisis, environmental racism,
  and finish off with a short rant about single issue vegans who deny that racism
  exists and then appropriate MLK day to fit their agenda.\n\n**ANNOTATION** It has
  been brought to my attention that the Salvation Army has a nasty history   of furthering
  the oppression of marginalized communities. I recommend sticking to the afore mentioned
  Flint Water Project of the United Way of Genesee. \nFor more information on the
