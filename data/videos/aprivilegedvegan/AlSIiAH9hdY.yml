title: 'No, VegSource: veganism is not (just) a diet'
description: "Hi everyone! \nThis is a response to VegSource's video titled \"You're
  not Vegan\" in which Mr. Nelson explains that the definition of veganism does not
  and should not include animal rights. \n\nThis video is in no way an attack on VegSource
  and what they have done for promoting plant-based diets. This video just seeks to
  dismantle the logic that more vegan diets necessarily correlate with animal liberation,
  and that plant-based diets should be the end goal of veganism. \n\nVegSource Video:
