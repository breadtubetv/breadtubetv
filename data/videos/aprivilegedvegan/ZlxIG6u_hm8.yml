title: Should vegans hate on slaughterhouse workers?
description: "The demonization of slaughterhouse workers in the vegan community, both
  on Youtube and on Facebook groups, is far too common. Because these stereotypes
  target people of color, and poor people, they are also racist and classist. By adopting
  a vegan diet, you are making the consumer choice to stop supporting the exploitation
  of workers and the suffering and death of animals in slaughterhouses. However, the
  lack on solidarity with slaughterhouse workers by many vegans is ignorant and shameful.
  We must connect the dots and realize that the SAME capitalist food system is responsible
  for the oppression and exploitation of humans and animals alike.\n\nFollow me on
