title: On ‘Othering’ and Climate Change
description: "What do systems of ‘othering’ have to do with climate change? “Othering”
  is another matrix through which to examine oppression. It reminds us why a pro-intersectional
  approach to ecological, economic, and social justice is fundamental: our fight for
  freedom must refuse all hierarchies that rank the relative value of living beings.\n\nUnfortunately,
  Naomi Klein does not consider speciesism as a system of ‘othering’. She hasn’t directly
  addressed the topic but does not advocate for a vegan diet/ lifestyle. Nonetheless,
  this video was inspired by her work on the othering of humans and climate change–
  I just took the concept and expanded it further. I just wanted to make that clear,
  and not risk attributing ideas to her that aren’t hers (for better or worst).\n\nFollow
