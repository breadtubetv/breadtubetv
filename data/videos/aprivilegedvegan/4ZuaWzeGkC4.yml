  scholarly study that looked at county-level shootings of civilians by police all
  across the U.S. found 1) That persons who are black and unarmed are about 3.5 times
  as likely to be shot by police as whites who are unarmed; 2) That blacks who are
  unarmed are just as likely to be shot by police as whites who are armed; 3) that
  in certain jurisdictions the ratio for the risk of an unarmed black person being
  shot compared to an unarmed white person being shot climbs as high as 20:1; and
  4) that these ratios can not be explained by local crime rate differences in general
  or black crime rates in particular \n\nEmotional and Physical Safety In Protests:
