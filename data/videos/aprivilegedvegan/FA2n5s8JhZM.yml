description: "Since Donald Trump's election, so many people who want to get involved
  and make a positive difference. \nBecoming vegan is one of the most impactful decisions
  you can make. Not only will you drastically reduce your carbon footprint, but by
  including animals in your anti-oppression framework, you will become a more effective
  advocate for social justice. As BIGD_OTheVegan said in the comments, \"Take a stand
  against the ideologies that Trump pumps!!!\"\nWhat better time than now to take
  a 30 day vegan pledge! You can (and should) do it!!! Ultimately, we all need to
  be vegan for life, but this is just a start to lure you in.... because once you
  make the connection, you'll never want to go back :D\n\nWant to take the pledge
