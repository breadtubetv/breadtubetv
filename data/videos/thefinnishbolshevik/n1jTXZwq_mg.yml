  Many people asked me about Fidel. Because my channel is not a news channel and so many others already made videos about Fidel I didn't feel like it was necessary to make a video about his death. Needless to say he was a great revolutionary & anti-imperialist hero, and a great example to all of us Communists. History has absolved him.
