title: The Finnish State sponsored Fascism in the 1930s
description: "The Finnish capitalist state tolerated and helped Fascism already before
  their alliance with Hitler in WWII.\n\nThe Finnish Fascist movement wanted Mannerheim
  to be their dictator. The Fascists attempted a Mussolini style coup in 1932 but
  it failed as most capitalist politicians preferred the facade of democracy. The
  coup had little to no popular backing and relied on the aid from politicians, military
  leaders & industrialists inside the government, the same way Mussolini did.\n\nThe
  coup was an act of treason, but none of the people involved got real sentences.
  Their leader only got 2 years of house arrest for his treasonable activities. \n\nThis
  should give an indication of how fascist the Finnish state was at the time. Nobody
  else except the Fascists, would have gotten merely 2 years (and not even in jail)
  for treason."
