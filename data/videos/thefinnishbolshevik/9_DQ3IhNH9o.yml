  This video was originally supposed to be uploaded to the RedScareTV channel:
  https://www.youtube.com/user/TheRedScareTV/videos

  Something happened to Mason (the guy behind RedScareTV) but he has said he'll be back. Hopefully he comes back soon.

  In the mean time I'm just gonna publish this on my own channel because so many people have asked me about this.
