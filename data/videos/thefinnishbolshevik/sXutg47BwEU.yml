title: 'Stephen Kotkin: Stalin''s rise to Power & Faked "Testament of Lenin"'
description: "SOME BACKGROUND:\n\nStephen Kotkin is a right-wing historian who specializes
  on the Stalin period. I don't agree with his views, he is a conservative and a pretty
  classical anti-communist. However some of the research, especially regarding primary
  source documents is interesting.\n\nIts worth pointing out that the idea that the
  \"Testament\" of Lenin was a forgery was not invented by Kotkin. Many marxists also
  believed this to be the case.\n\nOne of the proponents of the forgery hypothesis
  is V. Sakharov:\n\nThe Forgery of the 'Lenin Testament'\nhttp://www.revolutionarydemocracy.org/rdv7n1/LenTest.htm\n\nSome
  have also alleged that Lenin did dictate the document but had lost his senses due
  to illness. This was the opinion of Lenin's sister Maria Ulyanova. However this
  might be a convenient cover for her mother Krupskaya. \n\nKrupskaya had to have
  known about the forgery if it took place. However she became a support of Stalin's
  despite her earlier support for Zinoviev. Therefore this explanation could have
  been most convenient for all in the Stalin-team. \n\nThe charge leveled against
  Stalin in the \"testament\" is not one about politics, but about \"rudeness\". The
  bizarre nature of the charge contributed to the idea that it was not written by
  Lenin at all, or at least not when in full possession of his faculties. \n\nStalin
  himself never publicly discussed the authenticity of the \"testament\", instead
  he apologized and accepted the charge of \"rudeness\" but turned it into a weapon
  against his opponents, saying he can't help being rude to those who harm the Bolshevik
  party.\n\nLenin's \"testament\" is mostly brought up by Trotskyists. In deed the
  term was invented by them. However when hearing about most people think Lenin allegedly
  wanting to choose a successor is very anti-Lenin & anti-Bolshevik thing to do. It
  goes against his character to do such a thing. Lenin would have respected the party's
  vote, and certainly wouldn't have let personal issues or \"rudeness\" intervene
  with politics.\n\nIn the 1930s Trotsky claimed Lenin allegedly named him his successor
  in his \"testament\". However in 1925 Trotsky said:\n\n\"Lenin has not left any
  “Testament”; the character of his relations to the party, and the character of the
  party itself, preclude the possibility of such a “Testament.” \n~Trotsky, Letter
  on Eastman's book\n\nTrotsky could have been pressured into saying this, as anything
  else would have resulted in merciless ridicule by rival politicians. But its also
  possible Trotsky simply had more honesty and guts in 1925 then in his later years.\n\nMy
  own thoughts on the alleged forgery\nhttps://mltheory.wordpress.com/2017/02/07/on-the-alleged-forgery-of-lenins-testament/"
