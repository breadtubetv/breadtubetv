title: North Koreans teach Finns Taekwondo (ITF)
description: "Original ITF Taekwondo became more popular in North Korea while WTF
  Taekwondo was created by South Korea and the USA to replace ITF. \n\nWTF has since
  become more popular worldwide but both styles are still practiced.\n\nFounder of
  Taekwondo, Choi Hong Hi was a Korean nationalist anti-japanese fighter who later
  became a general in the South Korean army. He defected to North Korea in 1979. He
  is seen as unimportant or a traitor among WTF Taekwondo organizations.\n\nGeneral
  Choi founded the \"International Taekwondo Federation\" (ITF) in 1966. South Korea
  created the \"World Taekwondo Federation\" (WTF) in 1973 when Choi was in political
  exile in Canada."
