title: Achievements Of Socialism In The Soviet Union
description: "This is a video showcasing some of the things that were achieved during
  Socialism in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Mostly focusing on the Stalin
  era because thats when most of the breakthroughs happened but also the time of Lenin
  and shortly after Stalin's death in the 50s. Besides really its not about figureheads,
  its about what the society as a whole achieved in the worker's state.\n\nI will
  be making a follow up video highlighting the failures of Soviet revisionism that
  followed and dismantled the USSR.\n\nFeel free to ask any questions.\n\nFootage
  is from various documentaries on Youtube and from videos posted by comrade Kalinin1917.
  He uploaded a video with really nice color footage from the Soviet Union from the
  1940s and stuff like that which I simply had to take advantage of.\n\nMusic: \n\nT44
