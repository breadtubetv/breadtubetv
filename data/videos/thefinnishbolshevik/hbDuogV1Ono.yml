title: Response to Libertarian Socialist Rants & "Red Bureaucracy"
description: "1. Anarchists need to define exactly what they mean by Worker Control
  instead of sticking to their usual axiom \"its what ever we do and not what Marxists
  do\".\n\n2. Anarchism needs to demonstrate that it can reach stateless communism.
  Otherwise its fairly pointless to complain that Marxism hasn't done so, especially
  since Marxism never claimed to reach statelessness immediately unlike Anarchism.
  Marxism has a rational theoretical explanation for why Socialist states and Anarchist
  societies didn't achieve statelessness but Anarchist ideology is clueless about
  it instead opting for denial. This makes Anarchism a purely faith-based ideology.\n\n3.
  Anarchism has consistently failed to protect itself and instead of taking a look
  in the mirror always blames all of it's mistakes on everyone else. Marxists recognize
  the harm hostile forces have caused to Socialism and how Socialism has been hindered
  by it's enemies but such resistance is to be expected and we need to be able to
  live with it. Anarchists should learn this simple truth instead of screaming \"unfair\"
  and rage quitting at the first sign of trouble.\n\nSee my videos on CNT-FAI, Makhnovism
  and Withering Away of the State for more information and sources for claims specifically
  relating to those topics. Apart from that sources are mentioned in the video itself.\n\nActually
