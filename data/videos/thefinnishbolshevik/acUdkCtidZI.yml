title: Long Rebuttal of Trotskyist Nonsense
description: |-
  Rather long rebuttal of a lecture given by Alan Woods, a prominent Trotskyist. I randomly came across this video and found it particularly irritating and just decided to respond to.

  I also came across Alan Woods' material on multiple occasions while researching my previous video on Trotskyism so I was getting a bit fed up with him and his nonsense.

  Original lecture:

  All the sources for my claims about Trotsky are in my previous Trotskyism video.

  This video is a work of criticism and analysis and falls under Fair Use.
