title: 'Trotsky VS Lenin (The Facts: history and theoretical views)'
description: |-
  My attempt to showcase what Lenin and Trotsky really thought. Probably went a little overboard with the quotations but I figured that if I didn't then people would accuse me of taking them out of context.

  The reason I quoted C. Allen a lot is because he simply made good points with, had actual sources and numbers etc. and it was relevant to the issue.

  It took really long to research, write, record and edit the sound and video(the sound and video are still kinda shit) but I think I managed to make my point pretty clear.

  I know there are still some things that I simply couldn't fit into this video and will have to cover later. Expect a video specifically devoted to the Permanent Revolution "theory".

  I've made a blog where all video scripts will be posted. Also my research notes, useful quotations, statistics and things like that will be there so if you need material like feel free to check it out. I collect that kind of stuff on my computer anyway so I might as well share it.
