  Hey.

  I wanted to "tell my story" in a vlog. That's something that alcoholics do when they're sober for a year. Also, I haven't seen a lot of Online Leftist (tm) content about sobriety, so I just thought I'd make some.

  Basically, if you're feeling like shit and you've never tried sobriety, maybe give it a shot? It's been pretty good for me. Maybe it'll help you. You're worth the effort.

  Also, inb4 fat jokes and other jokes about my appearance. It's a bad angle and an iphone camera. I'm not fussed about it.
