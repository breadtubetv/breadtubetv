  text:\n\nI was shooting heroin and reading “The Fountainhead” in the front seat
  of my privately owned police cruiser when a call came in. I put a quarter in the
  radio to activate it. It was the chief. \n\n“Bad news, detective. We got a situation.”
  \n\n“What? Is the mayor trying to ban trans fats again?” \n\n“Worse. Somebody just
  stole four hundred and forty-seven million dollars’ worth of bitcoins.” \n\nThe
  heroin needle practically fell out of my arm. “What kind of monster would do something
  like that? Bitcoins are the ultimate currency: virtual, anonymous, stateless. They
  represent true economic freedom, not subject to arbitrary manipulation by any government.
  Do we have any leads?” \n\n“Not yet. But mark my words: we’re going to figure out
  who did this and we’re going to take them down … provided someone pays us a fair
  market rate to do so.” \n\n“Easy, chief,” I said. “Any rate the market offers is,
  by definition, fair.” \n\nHe laughed. “That’s why you’re the best I got, Lisowski.
  Now you get out there and find those bitcoins.” \n\n“Don’t worry,” I said. “I’m
  on it.” \n\nI put a quarter in the siren. Ten minutes later, I was on the scene.
  It was a normal office building, strangled on all sides by public sidewalks. I hopped
  over them and went inside. \n\n“Home Depot™ Presents the Police!®” I said, flashing
  my badge and my gun and a small picture of Ron Paul. “Nobody move unless you want
  to!” They didn’t. \n\n“Now, which one of you punks is going to pay me to investigate
  this crime?” No one spoke up. \n\n“Come on,” I said. “Don’t you all understand that
  the protection of private property is the foundation of all personal liberty?” \n\nIt
  didn’t seem like they did. \n\n“Seriously, guys. Without a strong economic motivator,
  I’m just going to stand here and not solve this case. Cash is fine, but I prefer
  being paid in gold bullion or autographed Penn Jillette posters.” \n\nNothing. These
  people were stonewalling me. It almost seemed like they didn’t care that a fortune
  in computer money invented to buy drugs was missing. \n\nI figured I could wait
  them out. I lit several cigarettes indoors. A pregnant lady coughed, and I told
  her that secondhand smoke is a myth. Just then, a man in glasses made a break for
  it. \n\n“Subway™ Eat Fresh and Freeze, Scumbag!®” I yelled. \n\nToo late. He was
  already out the front door. I went after him. \n\n“Stop right there!” I yelled as
  I ran. He was faster than me because I always try to avoid stepping on public sidewalks.
  Our country needs a private-sidewalk voucher system, but, thanks to the incestuous
  interplay between our corrupt federal government and the public-sidewalk lobby,
  it will never happen. \n\nI was losing him. “Listen, I’ll pay you to stop!” I yelled.
  “What would you consider an appropriate price point for stopping? I’ll offer you
  a thirteenth of an ounce of gold and a gently worn ‘Bob Barr ‘08’ extra-large long-sleeved
  men’s T-shirt!” \n\nHe turned. In his hand was a revolver that the Constitution
  said he had every right to own. He fired at me and missed. I pulled my own gun,
  put a quarter in it, and fired back. The bullet lodged in a U.S.P.S. mailbox less
  than a foot from his head. I shot the mailbox again, on purpose. \n\n“All right,
  all right!” the man yelled, throwing down his weapon. “I give up, cop! I confess:
  I took the bitcoins.” \n\n“Why’d you do it?” I asked, as I slapped a pair of Oikos™
  Greek Yogurt Presents Handcuffs® on the guy. \n\n“Because I was afraid.” \n\n“Afraid?”
  \n\n“Afraid of an economic future free from the pernicious meddling of central bankers,”
  he said. “I’m a central banker.” \n\nI wanted to coldcock the guy. Years ago, a
  central banker killed my partner. Instead, I shook my head. \n\n“Let this be a message
  to all your central-banker friends out on the street,” I said. “No matter how many
  bitcoins you steal, you’ll never take away the dream of an open society based on
  the principles of personal and economic freedom.” \n\nHe nodded, because he knew
  I was right. Then he swiped his credit card to pay me for arresting him."
