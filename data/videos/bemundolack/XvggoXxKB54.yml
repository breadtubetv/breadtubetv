title: Klimt, Master Copies, and Pattern | Quick Bites
description: Hello! Thank you for watching. I really do recommend that you do a master
  copy (or several) if you want to sharpen your skills. Copying a famous artist is
  like having a conversation with them. You'll never copy their work exactly, but
  the ways in which the works differ are the pieces of you truly shining through.
