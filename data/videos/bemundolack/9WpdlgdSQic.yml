  There were Nazis in my city, and I couldn't very well stay home, could I? In the wake of the Christchurch shootings, antifascist action is ever more important. If you'd like to learn how antifascism is done, feel free to reach out via Twitter and I'll do my best to connect you to resources. There are probably already groups near you doing antifascist work, so reach out to them and see how you can offer your help. You'd be surprised how many are on Facebook and Twitter.
