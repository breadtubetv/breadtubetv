title: Héctor García Cobo | Bemundolack Talks About Art
description: "In my quest for some art to talk about, I found some really wonderful
  photography in a textbook and thought I would share it with you all. \n\nAlso, I
  refer to him as Hector Garcia because that's how the textbook referred to him, but
  his proper name is in the title of the video. I'm using the 2nd edition of this
  textbook: https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/program/Marien-Photography-A-Cultural-History-4th-Edition/PGM28852.html\n\nHere
  is someone writing way more eloquently about it than I can speak about it: http://davidbaconrealitycheck.blogspot.com/search?q=garcia"
