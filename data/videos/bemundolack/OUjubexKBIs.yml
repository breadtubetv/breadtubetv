description: |-
  You may know Vermin Supreme from his weird, wacky antics like glitter bombing homophobic pundits and crashing Hillary Clinton's book signing with a pony civil suit, but Vermin has been an activist for over 30 years. He's done everything from wrangling police to anti-nuclear protest to environmental activism and Rainbow Gatherings. Hear him share some of his incredible experiences, and learn the finer points of his Pony Economic Plan.
