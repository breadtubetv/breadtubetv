description: |-
  In a continuation of my Hector Garcia video, here's one about his contemporary, Nacho Lopez. Two men in roughly the same areas at the same times, and their images are so different, but both so rich.

  By the way, "Nacho" is short for "Ignacio" which we say as "Ignacious" in English. It's the name of a saint. I was curious about his name lol
