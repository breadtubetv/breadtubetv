  Part 1 in a series on capitalism, exploring the foundation of capitalism and the mechanisms that place capital owners at the top - and workers at the bottom - of society. In this video, we trace the roots of capitalism all the way back to the decline of capitalism and look at some of the basic ways capitalists accumulate wealth and power at the expense of the working class.
