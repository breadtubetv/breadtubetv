title: Should Leftists Eat Meat PART 2 - Interview Followup *Live Stream*
description: |-
  Apologies for the technical difficulties AGAIN -- never had issues with power or internet at my apartment until I started live streaming :D We'll try to do a followup asap to finish the conversation. Thanks for watching  while you could!

  I will be holding a live stream interview with vegan Alex Krasny as a followup to our previously recorded interview. We will be addressing questions and comments from the audience as well as issues related to cultivated identity, gatekeeping, and the connections between veganism and leftism.
