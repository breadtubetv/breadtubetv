  Finally: a Halloween song for anarchists, communists, and puppets!

  Lyrics:
  Spooky scary socialists
  Shall seize the sovereign state
  Working proles will shock your soul
  Seal your class’s fate

  Spooky scary socialists
  In solidarity
  Marxists marching arm in arm
  Together can’t be beat

  Sorry bout this, capitalists
  You have had your fun
  Now it’s time to socialize
  The means of production

  Cause spooky scary socialists
  Shout “Workers all unite!”
  We’ll come together, raise our fists
  And demonstrate our might

  Silly centrist liberals
  Support the status quo
  But leftists won’t be satisfied
  Until its overthrown!

  Spooky scary socialists
  Are silly all the same
  We’ll dance and sing on Halloween
  And play our waiting game

  For Fascists might be laughing now
  But we can never lose
  Spooky scary socialists
  Will rise up with a boo!
