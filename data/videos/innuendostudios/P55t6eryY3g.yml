  Primary sources for this video were:
  Alt-America, by David Neiwert
  Healing from Hate, by Michael Kimmel*
  Terror, Love and Brainwashing, by Alexandra Stein

  *Kimmel's book was purchased before the sexual harassment accusations against him were made; the book is good but I do not endorse the writer.
