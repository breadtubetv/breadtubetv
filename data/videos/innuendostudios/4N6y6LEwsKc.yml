  SEMIOTICS

  A good place to start is Folding Ideas' (really old) video on signs and memes: https://youtu.be/rs0sybzUu24

  Here's a paper when you wanna go more in depth: http://www.indiana.edu/~slavicgf/assignments/Chandler_ch1_pt1.pdf

  DEATH OF THE AUTHOR

  I'd say the best place to start would be the essay "Greatly Exaggerated" by David Foster Wallace, but it's, sadly, not online. It's in this book: https://www.amazon.com/Supposedly-Fun-Thing-Never-Again/dp/0316925284

  Here's a rundown of the essay: http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/dfwwiki/index.php?title=Greatly_Exaggerated

  Here's Roland Barthes original essay that coined the phrase: http://www.tbook.constantvzw.org/wp-content/death_authorbarthes.pdf

  And here's Michel Foucault's expansion of the theory: http://www.movementresearch.org/classesworkshops/melt/Foucault_WhatIsAnAuthor.pdf

  ENUNCIATION THEORY

  The best way to acquaint yourself with enunciation theory is to read through the glossary of Casetti's Inside the Gaze: https://www.amazon.com/Inside-Gaze-Fiction-Spectator-Translation/dp/0253334438

  ...but here's an article on it: https://francescocasetti.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/filmtheoryandenunciation.pdf
