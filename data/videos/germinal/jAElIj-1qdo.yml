title: Reflecting on Montreal's Earth Strike March
description: I'm pretty sure YouTube doesn't allow people to advocate for violence.
  It's why in this video, I don't advocate for violence, but explain how some anarchists
  (for example Peter Gelderloos as cited at the beginning of the video) believe that
  violence is necessary to make things change.
