title: In Defense of Dark Souls 2
description: |-
  In this video we explore Dark Souls 2 and its differences from the previous games in design and execution and the ways, on inspection, it actually proves to be better.

  We also watch, in real time, as all my subscribers melt away and a dunce's hat descends from the heavens directly onto my balding head, and I start to go mad from the realisation that I'm still not sure whether to spell it Defense or Defence and words lose all meaning.
