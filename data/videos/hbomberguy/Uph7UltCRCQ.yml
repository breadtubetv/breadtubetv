title: Lords of the Fallen is a Difficult But Balanced Game
description: |-
  Lords of the Fallen is 'like Dark Souls', only a hundred thousand times better.

  A 'Speed Run' of this game is actively a better fighting strategy than real fighting. You can beat almost any boss by running at them and mashing the 'hold shield button''. I have a dozen hours of this on my hard drive.
