title: 'Measured Response: Bill Nye VS Pseudoscience (Part One)'
description: |-
  Bill Nye has gone too far this time. All the way to THE TRUTH! He'll pay for this!

  This is part one, recorded before I left for VidCon but not finished editing until after I got back.

  This video features a common staple of response videos: Lots of still images where I just talk for a bit. I hope my lack of tricks to distract you from my idiocy doesn't tank me
