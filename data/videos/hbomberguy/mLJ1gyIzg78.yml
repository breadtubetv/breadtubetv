title: Fallout 3 Is Garbage, And Here's Why
description: |-
  This is a review of Fallout 3, featuring retrospectives on the series as a whole, analysis of gameplay and storytelling mechanics, discussion of the games' initial critical reception, and the ability to absorb 1.5 hours of your human life right through the screen.

  It is also feature-length. Literally the length of numerous good films you could watch instead. Oops!
