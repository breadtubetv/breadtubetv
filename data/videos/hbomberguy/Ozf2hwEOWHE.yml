  Because I now have quite a few Patrons I've split the credits in half, the others are going in the next video! Thanks again! I couldn't afford to underpay Klaus for working on this without YOUR HELP!

  For extra fun, look up the 'comparisons' between the Spider-Woman and Spider-Man comic covers and note how, even though they're in the same pose (and therefore clearly it's all just feminazi whining), one cover was designed with a much more direct focus on the ass than the other. I wonder if you can guess which one that is?!!??
