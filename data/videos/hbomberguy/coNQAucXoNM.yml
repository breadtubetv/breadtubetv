title: Power Fantasy, Male Objectification and Lady-Fanservice
description: |-
  In this video, I explore the treatment of male characters and their equivalent female counterparts, and the way things one audience happens not to like are often confused with objective mistakes.

  I also strongly imply that pandering to feminism is literally the only way to make games better, so make sure to say I do that in your takedowns in the comments!

  Please note the backer list is split between this video and the next two planned for this month, so if you backed me in July and are wondering where your name is, the answer is, it's IN THE FUTURE!

  This video was co-written and features art by Klaus W:

  He drew tons of art I didn't use that will be used in a future video instead, because we accidentally wrote two videos.
