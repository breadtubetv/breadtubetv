title: 'Right to Resist Coalition: Start One in Your Town!'
description: "What is the Right to Resist Coalition? A coalition started by comrades
  from PSC-Austin and SJPNYC. Why should you start one? Do you want to resist war
  and empire or don't you? Fuck Memorial Day.\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/righttoresist/\n\nSign
  you and your org up here: \n\nhttps://right2resist.typeform.com/to/srsRd2\n\n\"We
  must revive a militant anti-war movement that will put an end to the destruction
  of our homelands, centering the right of oppressed nations to resist intervention
  and neo-colonialism. Through this campaign, Right to Resist War & Empire, we call
  on chapters of Students for Justice in Palestine, anti-imperialist organizations
  in all sectors, and youth organizations to take up this call to rebuild the anti-war
  movement.\""
