title: The Most Important Line in Sorry To Bother You
description: |
  #SorryToBotherYou #BootsRiley #TheCoup Being communist with no reservations,
  Boots Riley created the one of the most satisfying anti-capitalist feature films
  we’ve seen in a long-time. In it, megalomaniac CEO Steve Lift delivers the most
  important line in the film when caught in his evil scheme: "I just didn’t want
  you to think I was crazy. That I was doing this for no reason because this isn’t
  irrational.” But to make sense of it, we need to take a look back towards the
  greatest blunder of the 20th century: The Holocaust.
