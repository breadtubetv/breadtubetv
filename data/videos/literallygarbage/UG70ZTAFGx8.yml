title: Do certain people exist to be ruled?
description: |
  Throughout history, the answer to this question has been an easy, resounding, yes. Certain individuals exist
  to be ruled, and others exist to be rulers. Thankfully, meritocracy and liberal
  democracy has ushered in a world where we no longer need birth lotteries and such.
  Today, all success is guaranteed by effort and a little bit of charisma. Right?
