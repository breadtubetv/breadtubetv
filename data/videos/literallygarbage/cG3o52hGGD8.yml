  #FEE #capitalism #libertarianism The Foundation for Economic Education
  is a libertarian think-tank that posts video essays and memey videos to lure tweens
  into their cult. Here's a quote from their top contributor, Charles G. Koch (or
  maybe it's David, who can tell them apart?), "I'd like to choose my own kind of
  death, for a change. I'm tired of being tormented to hell. Tired of it."
