  In this EconoMinute, Richard D. Wolff talks about the revival of extreme right-wing movements (Nazis, white supremacists, Trump in the US; LePen in France, AfD in Germany) and attributes capitalismâ€™s instability (the 2008 crash and its legacies) and deepening inequalities for producing that revival.
