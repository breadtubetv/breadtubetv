title: Richard Wolff and John Duda talk about the co-op sector in Emilia Romagna
description: "\"It's not a monolith. It's not, you know, one great idea that just
  happened to be really, really successful. It's an ecosystem of innovation, of mutual
  support, of cooperative finance and all of these pieces fit together. And you have
  a situation where if you're talking to somebody on the street you have a 1 in 20
  chance of meeting somebody who's a worker owner in a worker co-op. It's an incredible,
  incredible cooperative density compared to the to the United States.\" - John Duda\n\nWatch
