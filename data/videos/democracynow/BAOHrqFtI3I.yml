  then please understand it's because you did not know about them before, not because
  there's anything wrong with the numbers. Over the last 20 years the People's Republic
  of China has increased its output of goods and services faster than any other country
  on this planet. In the case of the comparison between the People's Republic of China
  on the one hand and the United States of America on the other they're not even close.\"\n\nWatch

  E25] China's Economic Record and Strategy\nThis week on Economic Update, Professor
  Wolff follows up with part two of his in-depth analyses of the USSR and anti-capitalist
  governments by providing (1) an overview of China's economic development mostly
  over the last 25 years (GDP, real wages, etc.), and (2) its economic strategy: learning
  but also differing from Soviet strategy along with some relevant, and interesting,
  historical context.\n\nWe make it a point to provide the show free of ads. Please
