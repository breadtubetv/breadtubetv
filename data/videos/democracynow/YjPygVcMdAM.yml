  who have given a lifetime of work to our society that a pension serves, it's also
  the children of those people because if there isn't a pension for the older ones
  they really have nowhere else to turn but to their children. So it becomes then
  an economic concern for the entire family, not just the older folks, everybody who's
  connected to them.\"\n\n\nDue to the working holiday, there is not a new episode
  this week. Instead, we will be taking a look back. This clip comes from the episode
  \"Renewing Labors Movement\" which was published here on our Youtube channel on
  March 10, 2019. \n\n\n\nWatch entire episode: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3msEhXX7zgw&list=PLPJpiw1WYdTMLIyASxEheOVjl1vKkajYj&index=14&t=940s\n\nWe
