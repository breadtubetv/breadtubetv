  \n\nThe latest episode of Left Out will be released this Thursday 12/21/17. For
  this episode, we sat down with Christian Parenti to discuss climate change and our
  current political landscape. Parenti is a sociologist trained at the London School
  of Economics and is currently an economics professor at John Jay College (CUNY).
  \ \n\nIn our interview, we were able to ask Christian what it was like to straddle
  the realm between academia and journalism; prospects of climate catastrophe; climate
  change and  justice; and the role of both politics and the state in any real solutions
  for a way forward.\n\nLinks to Christian Parenti's recent work:  Tropic of Chaos:
  Climate Change and The New Geography of Violence; Anthropocene or Capitalocene?:
  Nature, History, and the Crisis of Capitalism."
