title: Richard Wolff Explains Indicators that the Economy is Not Doing Great
description: "\"One in four Americans during the year 2018 did without needed medical
  care because they could not afford it. 25%. That includes millions who have medical
  insurance but it still didn't cover something they needed and therefore they did
  without it. That's not an economy that's doing great, no matter how you slice it.\"\n\nWatch
