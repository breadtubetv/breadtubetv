  Update\" is devoted to Understanding Marxism, the title of a short new book just
  published by Democracy At Work. Today's program, like the book, explains Marxism's
  systemic insights into capitalism now. We discuss Marxism's basic criticisms of
  capitalism and also its complex relationship to socialism. Finally, we offer a survey
  of the last century of Marxism's huge, diverse influences on modern economics, politics
  and culture around the world.\n\nWatch entire episode:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENn8sQ6eFek&t=1165s\n\nWe
