title: 'WIN Short: Budweiser - The Un-American Beer'
description: "This is special feature is produced by Democracy at Work for  Workers
  Independent News. This is Richard Wolff for Democracy at Work.\n\nI want to talk
  today about an example of jobs lost, business loss, economic changes  made by a
  tiny number of people that affect everybody else.  It will be a story a little bit
  different from what we usually do. This is all about Budweiser beer, but actually
  let me be self-correcting here; it used to be called Budweiser beer. But, a few
  years ago Budweiser Corporation, based in St. Louis, decided it was more profitable
  for the few people who owned it and for the people who managed it, to sell out,
  and they sold to a Belgium company. Inbev, is the name of the company, based in
  Brussels, Belgium who now own the Budweiser brand. It is a Belgium beer not an American
  beer.  \n\nBut, in order to, how should we say this politely, persuade the American
  people to keep drinking this beer, which isn’t American anymore, were all the decisions
  are made in Belgium. What to produce, how to produce, the recipe, everything about
  it. In order to fool, excuse me, persuade Americans the name of the beer is going
  to be changed from May 23rd 2016 through the November election the beer will no
  longer say Budweiser on the can it will, “America”, I kid you not. \n\nInstead of
  the slogan ‘king of beers’ on the can will be “E Pluribus Unum,” the same phrase
  that appears on our currency. And instead of recipe for making the beer we are going
  to have, are you ready, the star spangled banners lyrics printed on the can. Trying
  to make it as American as possible so that American drinkers will continue to drink
  an American beer, who’s only detail of interest is that it is not American anymore.
  \n\nIf this sounds like a hustle, you’ve got it right. The decisions are made by
  a tiny number of people. They don’t have any loyalty to America, that’s why they
  sold it. They are not busy with it anymore. Our job is keep paying for it and drinking
  it. It’s something to think about."
