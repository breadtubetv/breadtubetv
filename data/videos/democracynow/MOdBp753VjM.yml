  to learn more and get updates on our meetings and future speakers. \n\nAt this meeting,
  we heard from two organizers from #DivestLA, a part of Revolution LA. \"Divest LA
  is a movement for revolutionary action at the local level. Our aim is to use our
  civic power to embolden Los Angeles city officials and residents to reinvest our
  money towards socially and environmentally conscious institutions.\"\n\nTrinity
  Tran founded Revolution LA in 2014, the grassroots progressive organization that
  became the catalyst for Divest LA and Public Bank LA. In February 2016, Trinity
  created the Divest LA organization to mobilize activists behind the campaign to
  move the City of Los Angelesâ€™ public funds from Wells Fargo Bank into ethical financial
  institutions. In June 2016, Trinity co-founded the Public Bank LA campaign to create
  a new epoch of finance through a socially and environmentally chartered municipal
  public bank. She believes Revolution is not about destruction, but creation and
  transformation. She enjoys maneuvering moving parts to solve complex problems.\n\nPhoenix
  Goodman is a co-founder of Revolution LA, a grassroots organization aimed at fundamentally
  transforming our political and economic system with a people and planet based agenda.
  Through Revolution LA, Goodman co-founded #DivestLA - a campaign that was successful
  in having the City of Los Angeles partly divest from Wells Fargo Bank due to the
  bank's unethical business practices. Most recently, #DivestLA has been involved
  with the initiative Public Bank LA, in order to develop the nation's first Municipal
  Public Bank. The institution would provide ethical and sustainable financial services
  for the city. Goodman develops policy recommendations for #DivestLA and Public Bank
  LA."
