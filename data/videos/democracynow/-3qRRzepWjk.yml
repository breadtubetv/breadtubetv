title: Richard Wolff offers context to those critical of Venezuela and Cuba's socialist
  systems.
description: "\"... a capitalist system brought to Latin America and South America
  by Europeans, left there managed now by their own elites, their wealthy elites.
  This is not a sustainable situation and finding fault with Cuba and Venezuela for
  how they have managed to get out of this situation is an inappropriate cheap shot
  that doesn't belong if you understand the economics of that part of the world.\"\n\nWatch
