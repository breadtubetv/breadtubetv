  3 Basic Kinds of Socialism\n\nThis week on Economic Update, Professor Wolff discusses
  the three basic kinds of socialism as anti-capitalist ideologies grow in the U.S.
  and more people are looking toward socialist alternatives. Prof. Wolff lays out
  the importance of grasping key differences among the alternative kinds of socialism.
  The first half of the show is an examination of those differences among (1) the
  moderate or \"democratic\" socialism ( a la Scandinavia), (2) the communist kind
  of socialism (in the USSR andÂ People's Republic of China) and (3) the new socialism
  focused on democratizing the work place. \n\nThe second half of the show focuses
  on  how doing better than capitalism will require deciding which of these three
  kinds of \"socialism\" (or what combination of them) will be a better economic structure
  for the masses.\n\nRead the transcript here: https://www.democracyatwork.info/eu_3_basic_kinds_of_socialism\n\nFollow
