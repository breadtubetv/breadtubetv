  which the big banks literally did every illegal and unethical thing imaginable.
  They manipulated interest rates (the LIBOR scandal), they got caught manipulating
  foreign exchange rates, they got caught charging people for fees they shouldn't
  have, they got caught mismanaging the mortgage crisis, you name it. Oh I forgot
  laundering criminal money. Shouldn't forget that. They got caught. They paid billions
  in fines. After a record ten years like that the \"logical\" thing is to give them
  less regulation. I told you it'd take your breath away.\"\n\nWe make it a point
