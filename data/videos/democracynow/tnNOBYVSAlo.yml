  \ Please hit the red SUBSCRIBE button above. ^^^\n\nThis week on Economic Update,
  Professor Wolff goes beyond the simplistic, sterile Cold War debates of demonizers
  vs celebrants of the USSR as he delivers an in depth analysis of the USSR's strengths,
  weaknesses, successes and failures from its revolutionary beginnings in 1917 to
  its implosion in 1989. The first episode of a special 2-part series where Professor
  Wolff gives the same in-depth analysis for the People's Republic of China in the
  second part.\n\nWatch entire episode:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Y-TWFKw4tU&t=135s\n\nWe
