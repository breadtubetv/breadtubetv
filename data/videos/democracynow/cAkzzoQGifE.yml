  Income\n\nOn this week's show Prof. Wolff presents an in-depth analysis of UBI shows
  its advantages over most welfare, safety net systems. An even better alternative
  would avoid capitalism's unnecessary production of unemployment because it utilizes
  technical progress (rising productivity) for profits. The alternative benefits workers'
  leisure rather than profits. It is more democratic and avoids splitting people into
  unemployed vs employed, non-poor vs poor population.\n\n\nFollow us ONLINE: \nPatreon:
