title: Richard Wolff on Uber founder's $72.5 million home purchase while drivers strike
  for better wages
description: "\"Not paying Uber drivers so that they can't afford a home and have
  to live in a tent, or they can't afford a decent living even if they have home,
  that's what's necessary so that the Uber founder, the head of the company, can live
  in a $72.5 million mansion...  You tell me what your ethics, your religion and your
  morality suggest is the way to go here.\" \n\nThis clip comes from the episode titled
  \"Reparations and Forgiving Student Debt.\" Watch the entire episode here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGWusrf6NC4&t=1084s\n\nWe
