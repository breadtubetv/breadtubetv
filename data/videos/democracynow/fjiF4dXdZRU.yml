  On this week's Economic Update, Prof. Wolff presents updates on French election's significance; Obama's $400,000 bank speaking fee; US corp tax cuts; Wells Fargo "saved" by Warren Buffett; why bringing home US corps' foreign profits just helps them. On the second half of the show, Prof. Wolff is joined by Dr. Harriet Fraad who talks about the contradictions of "family values" in the US economy.
