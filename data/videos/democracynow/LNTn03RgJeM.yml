  if you don't already, what inequality means and here's a juicy example. It means
  people who can't make it in other ways use their money to do what their brains,
  for example, don't allow them to do. You can't get your kid into school, buy the
  way in... But I want you to keep in mind that when people flash a college degree,
  a university degree, a Harvard degree, a USC degree, keep in mind what it really
  means: it's a crapshoot. You may be getting someone who knows something but you're
  just as likely to get someone whose money is what you're talking to.\"\n\nWatch
