  of Economic Update asks: \"If democracy is about everyone deciding a common direction
  together under a single umbrella of democratic institutions, how would checks, balances
  and balance of power (between different equally democratic umbrellas of institutions
  in different jurisdictions) work? Assuming that maximization of value creation (instead
  of value extraction) is desired and also assuming that longer term expenditures
  (education, childcare, healthcare, international infrastructure (e.g. future new
  projects similar to \"China Silk road\"), greenhouse effect prevention) are needed
  to create value on a longer term, does there yet exist any suggestion of a vision
  for a suitable jurisdictional split of areas of responsibility for these (and all
  the zillion other areas I haven't thought of) different longer term expenditure
  areas?\"\n\nThanks to volunteer Connor B. for transcribing this video!\n\nWant to
