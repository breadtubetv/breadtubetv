  Vitale is professor of sociology and coordinator of the Policing and Social Justice
  Project at Brooklyn College. He has spent the last 25 years consulting police departments
  and human rights groups internationally. In his new book, \"The End of Policing,\"
  he argues that the bulk of liberal police reforms currently being considered in
  the US are either ineffective or counterproductive and what's really needed is a
  dramatic reduction in our reliance on police. \n\n\n  ."
