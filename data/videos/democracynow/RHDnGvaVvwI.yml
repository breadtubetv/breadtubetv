  For this episode of Left Out we sat down with Christian Parenti to discuss climate
  change and our current political landscape. Parenti is a sociologist trained at
  the London School of Economics and is currently an economics professor at John Jay
  College (CUNY).  \n\nIn our interview, we were able to ask Christian what it was
  like to straddle the realm between academia and journalism; prospects of climate
  catastrophe; climate change and  justice; and the role of both politics and the
  state in any real solutions for a way forward.\n\n\nLinks to Christian Parenti's
