  looks at 3 main kinds of socialism and how they affect the mass of people. In this
  clip he addresses the third, democratizing the workplace.\n\n\"I think the idea
  of this third socialism is to achieve something in your daily life that the other
  two socialisms never did. That when the first kind had the government regulation
  or the second kind (the communist kind) had the government take over, the transformation
  of the workplace never happened. You were still the worker who comes and does what
  he or she is told for the 8 hours and then goes home. This is a new world, this
  third kind of socialism.\"\n\nWatch entire episode:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7x7oVwhHok&t=929s\n\nWe
