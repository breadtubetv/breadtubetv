  Tires: http://www.rcotires.com\n---\n\nIn the second half of our monthly meetings,
  we bring in a guest speaker, and share their talk here as well. But if you're in
  the Los Angeles area and would like to see our guest speakers live, go to: http://eepurl.com/cJW7dX
  to sign up for our mailing list, or go to our website (www.democracyatwork-la.com)
  to learn more and get updates on our meetings and future speakers. \n\nIn April,
  we were joined by Niki Okuk and Bryan \"Magnum\" from RCO² Tires, a tire recycling
  / re-manufacturing factory in Compton. Niki, a graduate of economics from Columbia
  and MIT, returned to her hometown of LA to start RCO² Tires. Bryan, a formerly incarcerated
  artist, was brought on in the early stages of the business and is now the foreman.
  RCO² Tires as grown a lot in the last 4 years and also recently unionized. But it's
  ultimate goal is to become a worker cooperative. This is a challenge for multiple
  reasons (practical and cultural) but one that they are determined to achieve. They
  came to d@w-Los Angeles to share their experiences, hopes, concerns and more.\n\nAt
  Democracy at Work - Los Angeles (d@w-Los Angeles), we endeavor to further our parent
  organization’s purpose, that is, raising awareness and generating a positive cultural
  shift towards Worker Self-Directed Enterprises. WSDEs are a way to reorganize our
  workplaces in a truly democratic fashion, where decision-making power and wealth
  are shared equally. Through promotion, education, and connection with local organizations,
  we aim to be a hub in Los Angeles that advocates for and facilitates the transformation
  of our economic system.\n\n---\n“We can, and we must, do better than capitalism.”
