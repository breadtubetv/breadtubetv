title: 'Economic Update: Working Class History and the 2020 Election [Trailer]'
description: "This special program discusses how the history of the US working class
  shaped US politics. We start with how and why the 1930s Great Depression married
  the US working class to FDR's Democratic Party (New Deal Coalition). We next show
  how and why after 1945, US business leaders and Republicans broke up that marriage
  to undo the New Deal. By re-building working class divisions - especially around
  race and gender - males and whites moved toward the GOP. A weakened Dem party responded
  by appealing to (and thereby dividing) business interests to support them. The two
  parties thus became almost identically pro-capitalist and both presided over growing
  inequalities in income, wealth and political power between the richest 10% and the
  working class. Building to 2016, working class disgust with both parties showed
  in disinterest, ambivalence, and the growing role of \"cultural\" differences in
  place of working class solidarity. It boiled over when an \"outsider\" (Trump) defeated
  first the Republican and then the Democratic establishment candidates, an expression
  of the working class's history since 1929. We end on the implications of this history
  for the 2020 election.\n\nWatch the entire episode here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XODoZEq_-GU&t=871s\n\nWe
