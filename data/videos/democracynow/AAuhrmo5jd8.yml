title: Richard Wolff on Huawei & Trump's Government Interference for Personal Gain
description: "\"It is a message that every CEO of every company in the world has just
  sent a memo down the line of their company: cut business with Americans, reduce
  dependence on Americans, find business partners elsewhere in countries that don't
  do this. And why is it all being done? To advance Mr. Trump's career opportunities.\"
