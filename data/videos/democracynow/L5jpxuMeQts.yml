  E12] Clip \n\nIn the full episode, Dr. Fraad talks about the re-emergence of the
  Womenâ€™s Movement. Unlike the 1960s and 1970s, the need for basic economic change
  applies to both men and women together rather than women versus men, one gender
  versus the other. The American economic boat is sinking: men and women are drowning
  together. Only a movement unified around class differences and addressing all issues
  together will have a chance to win the lasting change we need.\n\n\nFollow us ONLINE:
