title: 'Left Out: David Harvey on Marx, Capital & the Madness of Economic Reason'
description: "Left Out, a podcast produced by Paul Sliker, Michael Palmieri, and Dante
  Dallavalle, creates in-depth conversations with the most interesting political thinkers,
  heterodox economists, and organizers on the Left. \n\nIn this episode, we speak
  with David Harvey about his latest book, MARX, CAPITAL, AND THE MADNESS OF ECONOMIC
  REASON, as well as what the Left most focus on to effectively organize for a better
  economy and society.\n\n*** Please support Left Out on Patreon. We need your support

  arguably the most influential living geographer, as well as one of the world’s leading
  Marxist scholars. He is among the most cited intellectuals of all time across the
  humanities and social sciences.\n\nHarvey currently works as distinguished professor
  of anthropology and geography at CUNY, where he has been teaching Marx’s “Capital:
  Critique of Political Economy” for more than four decades. His course on Marx’s
  Capital has been downloaded by over two million people internationally since appearing
  online in 2008.\n\nHarvey is also a famous author of several bestselling books,
  including The Enigma of Capital, A Brief History of Neoliberalism, 17 Contradictions
  and the End of Capitalism, and many more.\n\nHis latest book, Marx, Capital and
  the Madness of Economic Reason (out today), makes the core of Karl Marx’s thinking
  in the three volumes of Capital clear and accessible for the lay reader, without
  compromising their depth and complexity.\n\nMarx's trilogy concerns the circulation
  of capital: volume I, how labour increases the value of capital, which he called
  valorisation; volume II, on the realisation of this value, by selling it and turning
  it into money or credit; and volume III, on what happens to the value next in processes
  of distribution.\n\nAs Harvey argues in our interview, most people who read Capital
  often stop after the 1,152 pages of Volume I, which is very problematic if you want
  to understand the workings of capital as a totality.\n\nWe ask Harvey why understanding
  all three volumes of Capital is so crucial, and why technological, economic and
  industrial change over the last 150 years makes Marx’s analysis more relevant now
  than ever.\n\nIn the last half of the discussion, we probe into whether it’s necessary
  for social movements today to develop a stronger institutional basis for understanding
  how capital and capitalism works, and ask Harvey what the Left most focus on to
  effectively organize for a better economy and society."
