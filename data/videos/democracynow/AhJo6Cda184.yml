  media picked up on something that wasn't in the actual legislation but in a frequently
  asked question support document that had been put out around the same time. And
  there was a reference very far down that the system, the economic system that was
  being visualized, would provide money and support for those people that were unable
  or unwilling to work. And so out of 2,000 words they zeroed in on that and they
  didn't reflect on the fact that right above that was reference to something that
  I'm sure your viewers and listeners are familiar with, Franklin Delano Roosevelt's
  second bill of rights, which was given as part of the State of the Union dress in
  1944, which really talked about the fact that this country was at a point where
  it had gone as far as it could in terms of delivering on the Bill of Rights, a political
  document, but it had fallen far short because so many people were in need.\"\n\nWe
