  Lee Carter was elected in the historic 2017 wave in Virginia, and he currently serves
  the people of Manassas and Prince William County in the House of Delegates. He was
  inspired to run after being hurt on the job and subsequently failed by Virginia’s
  worker compensation system. Delegate Carter has spent the last two years fighting
  for worker protections, healthcare for all Virginians, criminal justice reform,
  and consumer rights. He's up for reelection this November."
