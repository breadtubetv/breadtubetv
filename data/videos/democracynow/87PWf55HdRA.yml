  - Part 1\n\nThank you for supporting Capitalism Hits Home on Patreon! Your support
  helps us compensate the staff and additional workers it takes to put an episode
  together. Thank you for being a part of the CHH team! \n\nThe US has had a class
  revolution in the household over the last 50 years and the left did not notice,
  no less champion that revolution. Hot button issues like abortion and birth control
  rights or family leave are shadow battles in that revolution. It is time to pay
  attention.\n\nFollow us ONLINE: \nWebsites: https://www.democracyatwork.info/capitalismhitshome\nhttps://www.harrietfraad.com/\nFacebook:
