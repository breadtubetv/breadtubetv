  \ Please hit the red SUBSCRIBE button above. ^^^\n\nProf. Wolff presents updates
  on (1) the US public education crisis (teacher strikes, declining quality, insufficient
  resources) and how it undermines the US's economic future, (2) the absurdity of
  the government shutdown over an ineffective wall and a tiny portion of the government's
  budget, and (3) how the schools crisis and the shutdown signal a larger social decline.
  The second part of the show features an interview with Professor Alex Vitale on
  his book, The End of Policing, and why US police have grown and changed their functions
  so drastically in recent decades.\n\nTo watch the full episode:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiQ_I6X80vI&t=1078s\n\nSupport

  Vitale is professor of sociology and coordinator of the Policing and Social Justice
  Project at Brooklyn College. He has spent the last 25 years consulting police departments
  and human rights groups internationally. In his new book, \"The End of Policing,\"
  he argues that the bulk of liberal police reforms currently being considered in
  the US are either ineffective or counterproductive and what's really needed is a
  dramatic reduction in our reliance on police."
