title: Richard Wolff and Ric McIntyre Discuss if Capitalism is in Decline
description: "\"The other thing that happened as a result of the 2008 crisis is the
  Fed acted to bailout the whole world. So now the dollar is more firmly in place
  as the currency of choice then it has ever been... I think that American capitalism
  is in decline on the one hand but extraordinarily successful on the other, in different
  sectors in different regions.\"  - Ric McIntyre\n\nWatch entire episode:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfAtjJb2-ss&t=1242s\n\nWe
