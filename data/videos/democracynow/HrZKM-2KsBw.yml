title: Richard Wolff on the IMF's assessment of the US's Economic Decline
description: "\"If you don't cherry-pick the statistics that make things look good
  and carefully avoid looking at those that don't, if you don't do that kind of lopsided
  behavior, you get much closer to the IMF's assessment than to Mr. Trump's self-serving
  effort at re-election next year.\"\n\nWatch entire episode:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2oDSEbiAZE&t=1093s\n\nWe
