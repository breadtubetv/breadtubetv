  [S8 E24] The Great American Purge\n\nThis week’s episode of Economic Update is a
  little different from the usual program. Professor Wolff begins by explaining the
  economics behind the great U.S. anti-leftist purge (“McCarthyism”) after 1945. It
  then shows the economic impacts of that purge over the last half century. \n\nIn
  the second half, Prof. Wolff explains how that history produced a very different
  political response to the crash of 2008 compared to FDR’s response in 1929.\n\nRead
