  works, always has. You identify something in the society that needs fixing and then
  you fix it. You come up with a better way of doing it, a better way of thinking
  about it, a better way of approaching a problem. That's why we don't rub sticks
  together to make a fire. We've learned something. And that was because people early
  on said \"there must be a better way to start a fire than spending all this time
  rubbing these two damn wet sticks together\". Well if you don't criticize capitalism
  in school you'll prevent people from learning to think critically about their system
  and that undercuts progress.\"\n\nSupport the show! Become an EU patron on Patreon:
