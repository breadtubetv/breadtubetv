  in serious trouble. Former standards of masculinity as aggression, power, and stoic
  denial of emotional vulnerability are now widely considered toxic. The economic
  dominance that white men had with family wages disappeared when American capitalists
  mechanized, computerized, and outsourced white men's jobs from the 1970s on. Manhood
  has changed its demands. \n\nAmerican women had a movement behind us when we changed
  our roles and poured into the labor force . Men do not have that powerful group
  support. Is it any wonder that all of America's far too frequent mass shootings
  are perpetrated by men?  I hope this pod cast helps us understand men's confusion
  and suffering and helps to transform it into new human possibilities.\n\nFollow
