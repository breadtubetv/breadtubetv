  USSR\n\nThis week on Economic Update, Professor Wolff goes beyond the simplistic,
  sterile Cold War debates of demonizers vs celebrants of the USSR as he delivers
  an in depth analysis of the USSR's strengths, weaknesses, successes and failures
  from its revolutionary beginnings in 1917 to its implosion in 1989. The first episode
  of a special 2-part series where Professor Wolff gives the same in-depth analysis
  for the People's Republic of China in the second part.\n\nRead transcript on our
