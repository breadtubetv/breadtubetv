title: 'WIN Short: The Panama Papers'
description: "This special feature is produced by Democracy at Work for Worker Independent
  News (WIN). This is Richard Wolff from Democracy at Work. \n\nThis last week has
  been a bombshell. Something called the Panama Papers is all over the news.  What’s
  it about? A law firm exists in Panama that basically creates phony companies called
  shell companies that enable rich corporations around the world and wealthy individuals
  to hide their wealth to make sure other people don’t know about it, to make sure
  governments don’t know about it, to make sure they don’t have to pay taxes on it.
  \ For lots of reasons, legal and illegal, it’s a place to hide money.  \n\nHow big
  is it? Well, the answer is, its worth trillions of dollars.  Let me say that again,
  trillions of dollars.  And here is the point.  A professor at the University of
  California, in Berkley, Named Gabriel Zucman, has calculated 7-8 trillion dollars
  of money being hidden by the wealthy so they don’t have to pay taxes.  \n\nAnd why
  is it important?  Because we are being told by politicians across the United States
  and around the world that they have to impose an austerity on us, raise taxes on
  our jobs and incomes, lower the services they can provide to us, lay off public
  employees that provide those services. Why? Because there isn’t the money, the taxes
  aren’t being paid, the government doesn’t have the wealth.\n\nBut of course it does.
  It always did. And the revelations around the Panama Papers prove it all, as if
  we really needed it.  The money is there, it’s hidden, but we know where it’s hidden.
  \ That’s what these revelations enable us to see.  It’s long past due that the politicians
  stop with the fake excuses that they can’t provide the services and the public sector
  jobs that this country needs. Go after the people we know are hiding it and evading
  the taxes. Do what you should have been doing for the mass of people all along.
