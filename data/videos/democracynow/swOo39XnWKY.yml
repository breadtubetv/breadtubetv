  Grossman, born Stephen Wechsler, a New York red-diaper baby of the 1930s, joined
  the Communist Party as a Harvard student. Fleeing the U.S. Army during the McCarthy
  Era, he swam the Danube River to the Soviet Zone of Austria and was sent to East
  Germany. There, he studied journalism and became a freelance writer and popular
  speaker. He was pardoned by the U.S. Army in 1994 and, in 2003, published an autobiography,
  Crossing the River: A Memoir of the American Left, the Cold War, and Life in East
  Germany ((U. of Mass.Press).  Victor Grossman will be visiting Washington, DC from
  May 15-May 18 on a national book tour of his latest book weighing problems of GDR
  socialism and modern capitalism entitled A Socialist Defector: From Harvard to Karl-Marx-Allee
  by Monthly Review press."
