  Dr. Fraad talks about the re-emergence of the Womenâ€™s Movement. Unlike the 1960s
  and 1970s, the need for basic economic change applies to both men and women together
  rather than women versus men, one gender versus the other. The American economic
  boat is sinking: men and women are drowning together. Only a movement unified around
  class differences and addressing all issues together will have a chance to win the
  lasting change we need.\n\n\nFollow us ONLINE: \nWebsites: https://www.democracyatwork.info/capitalismhitshome\nhttps://www.harrietfraad.com/\nFacebook:
