  redundant to put the 'Eco' prefix out there because socialism implies that you make
  decisions on the basis of what's in the interests of people and you can't legislate
  in the interests of people without taking into account the environment. However,
  because of the historical evolution of the awareness of these different dimensions
  the 'Eco' has to be added on for purposes really of emphasis.\"\n\nSupport the show!
