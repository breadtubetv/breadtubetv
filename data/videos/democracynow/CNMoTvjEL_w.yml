  A patron asks: "I saw your recent EU video on China and I had a question about the history of their economic progress. Many champions of capitalism view the enormous growth of China over the last 30 years as a result of opening their economy up to competition on the world market and adopting capitalist features. They then champion this as an example of capitalism driving success. Is the view that capitalism led to the surge in China's economy accurate? I personally believe that the history of this trend is much more complicated, but I wanted to get your thoughts on whether or not this view of China's success is accurate or if the capitalist view is misguided."
