  highlights the struggle between those holding on to former gender roles with women
  serving men and children and those recognizing the opportunity that we now have
  to be equal partners in the home and at work. Movements like #Metoo or #Timesup,
  March for Women, or abortion rights, and many more, support the conditions of existence
  for equal partnership. This is a moment of gender struggle that surrounds all of
  us in the USA today.\n\nFollow us ONLINE: \nWebsites: https://www.democracyatwork.info/capitalismhitshome\nhttps://www.harrietfraad.com/\nFacebook:
