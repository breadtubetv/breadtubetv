  United States is lower today than it was in 1973 and that is something to think
  about. But now comes the Chinese story. Over the same period of time, the last 20-25
  years, real wages in the People's Republic of China have quadrupled.\" \n\n\nWatch

  E25] China's Economic Record and Strategy\nThis week on Economic Update, Professor
  Wolff follows up with part two of his in-depth analyses of the USSR and anti-capitalist
  governments by providing (1) an overview of China's economic development mostly
  over the last 25 years (GDP, real wages, etc.), and (2) its economic strategy: learning
  but also differing from Soviet strategy along with some relevant, and interesting,
  historical context.\n\nWe make it a point to provide the show free of ads. Please
