  been abused for centuries. This podcast examines the sea change in US gender roles
  that has rendered toxic masculinity outmoded and intolerable.That gender metamorphosis
  is a powerful impetus for social ,personal and political movements against sexual
  abuse. At the same time there is a powerful American backlash of right wing misogynists
  from Incels to Trump.This podcast explores the interaction of the economy, politics
  and psychology as they transform gender, US personal life and the routine practice
  of sexual assault.\n\nFollow us ONLINE: \nWebsites: https://www.democracyatwork.info/capitalismhitshome\nhttps://www.harrietfraad.com/\nFacebook:
