  from the the tacit acceptance of what is and ask the question 'What do we want this
  to be? What could the world be?' And I do think worker co-ops are a step in that
  direction.\"\n\nMatthias Scheiblehner is a longtime carpenter, builder, and student
  of history from the Seattle area.  He founded Mētis Construction Inc. in 2008.  In
  early 2016, he and 17 coworkers completed the process of restructuring Mētis as
  a worker controlled, trust held cooperative.\n\nFollow us ONLINE: \nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/economicupdate\nWebsites:
