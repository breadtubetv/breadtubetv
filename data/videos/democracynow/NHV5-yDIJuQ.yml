  - Los Angeles (d@w-Los Angeles), we endeavor to further our parent organization’s
  purpose, that is, raising awareness and generating a positive cultural shift towards
  Worker Self-Directed Enterprises. WSDEs are a way to reorganize our workplaces in
  a truly democratic fashion, where decision-making power and wealth are shared equally.
  Through promotion, education, and connection with local organizations, we aim to
  be a hub in Los Angeles that advocates for and facilitates the transformation of
  our economic system.\n\n---\n“We can, and we must, do better than capitalism.” -
