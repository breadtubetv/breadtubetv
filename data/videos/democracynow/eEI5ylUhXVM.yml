  speaks to the attendees of Democracy at Work Los Angeles' fundraiser in April of
  2017. Part 1 of 2.\n\nDemocracy at Work Los Angeles is a local volunteer action
  group, working to further the goals of the national org directly in our community.
  We wish to see more worker co-ops in LA, legislation and anchor groups which favor
  their existence, and more schools which teach them as a viable business alternative.
  We hold monthly meetings, create content, build connections, and generally exist
  as a hub for collaboration, a platform for action, and voice calling for a cultural
  shift towards democracy in the workplace.\n---\nVideo shot and edited by Mansoor
