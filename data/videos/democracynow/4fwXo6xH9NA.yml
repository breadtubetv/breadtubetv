  [S9 E05] Socialism Past to Future\n\nOn this episode of Economic Update, Prof. Wolff
  begins with an overview of socialism's history, especially in the U.S. where it
  was widely discussed up to 1945, then repressed in the Cold War and now vigorously
  revived since the crash of 2008. He then examines socialism's basic economic criticism
  of capitalism in the 20th century. \n\nIn the second half of the show, Prof. Wolff
  goes on to show how and why socialism, as it is re-emerging now, is new and different.\n\nFollow
