  ***\n\nIn this episode, we sat down with Christian Parenti to discuss climate change
  and our current political landscape. Parenti is a sociologist trained at the London
  School of Economics and is currently an economics professor at John Jay College
  (CUNY). He’s written extensively on the connection between climate change and geopolitical
  conflict around the globe and has reported from war zones in Afghanistan, Iraq,
  as well as parts of Africa, Latin America, and Asia. His writing has appeared in Fortune, The
  Washington Post, The New York Times, Middle East Report, London Review of Books,
  Mother Jones, and The Nation (where he is Contributing Editor).\n\nIn 2011 he authored
  the book, Tropic of Chaos: Climate Change and The New Geography of Violence , which
  explored how climate change is already causing violence as it interacts with the
  legacies of economic neoliberalism and cold-war militarism. His latest piece of
  work is featured in Anthropocene or Capitalocene?: Nature, History, and the Crisis
  of Capitalism, alongside a collection of provocative essays on nature and power,
  humanity, and capitalism framed within a politics of hope that signal the possibilities
  for transcending capitalism.\n\nIn our interview, we were able to ask Christian
  what it was like to straddle the realm between academia and journalism; prospects
  of climate catastrophe; climate change and climate justice; and the role of both
  politics and the state in any real solutions for a way forward.\n\n*** Please donate
