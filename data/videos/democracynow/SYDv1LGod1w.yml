title: Richard Wolff on Tax Reform
description: "\"So Ocasio-Cortez was right more than she said. Tax reform can and
  should be done across the board, wherever taxes are unfair [and] discriminatory,
  because they're always unfair and discriminatory in one particular way: the more
  you have, the more the tax system has been manipulated and changed over several
  decades (at least since the Second World War) to favor those at the top at the expense
  of everybody else.\"\n\nWatch entire episode:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e3Zakd6xJs&list=PLPJpiw1WYdTMLIyASxEheOVjl1vKkajYj&index=29&t=0s\n\nWe
