title: 'WIN Short: VW And Mitsubishi – Profit Over Public Health'
description: "This special feature is produced by Democracy at Work for Worker Independent
  News (WIN). This is Richard Wolff for Democracy at Work.\n\nWell the last few days
  have been full of reports about two global car companies, VW out of Germany and
  Mitsubishi out of Japan.  These are among the handful of companies dominating the
  world automobile production process. And both of these companies have been in the
  news for the same reason. They got caught, cheating on emission tests. Deliberately
  installing on their machines devices that would fool testers into thinking they
  weren’t emitting into the air the terrible disease causing particulates, they’re
  called, that come out of the exhaust pipe of your car or your truck or your bus.
  \n\nLet's review quickly, VW it was caught months ago. And the headlines of the
  last week were about the fact that it is looking to pay $5000 to each person who
  bought such a  defective car and maybe pay for the repairs if the owners want them
  and so on. They are hoping to pay billions in this way to put this terrible publicity
  for them, being caught as liars, cheaters, polluters, driven by profit, to really
  hurt the whole world they live in.\n\nMitsubishi, well they haven’t been in the
  news before but now they are. They got caught. Doing what? Doing the same thing
  and they produces a million cars last year.   Yup, they put in software that fools
  the testing equipment so it is not revealed they are pumping dangerous materials
  into the air we all breathe. Common folks, join with me in recognizing that just
  as we saw in recent years that the big banks violated the public trust, took us
  to the cleaners to make money, that is what the car companies are doing. Leaving
  important industries in the hands of private capitalist like this is damaging for
  our health.  Profit trumps decent behavior and what’s good for the public.\n\nDONATE:
