  and Nati Lombardo from the Loomio team are partnering up with Democracy at Work
  Los Angeles Action Group to offer a co-created workshop on collaborative culture
  and non-hierarchical organizing. \n\nWe combine storytelling and participation to
  learn together about democratic, bottom-up organizing at different scales: from
  co-ops, to networks, cities and nations. We'll offer some practices and tools that
  have helped us, and discover the intelligence in the room too.\n\nRich and Nati
  have been engaged in the craft of participatory organizing for more than five years,
  starting with Occupy in 2011, co-founding Loomio (a worker co-op building software
  for collective decision-making) and Enspiral (a network of 250 tech activists experimenting
  with radical organizational forms). \n\nFor more information: \nwww.loomio.coop
