title: 'WIN Short: Sweden: Shorter Work Days, Higher Productivity'
description: "This is special feature is produced by Democracy at Work for Workers
  Independent News. This is Richard Wolff for Democracy at Work.\n\nI want to report
  to you today about an experiment made in the city of Gothenburg, Sweden by a work
  of workers supervised by the city council in that city. Under the pressure of a
  left wing political party that has seats on that city council, the experiment was
  as follows. \n\nThe argument was made that workers in Sweden who have for 40 years
  had a 40 hour work week, that workers in Sweden were reporting in sick more and
  more often and were increasingly taking early retirement and felt that was because
  work exhausted them. So the left wing party made a proposal that the city council
  expected. ‘Let us try and take a group of workers reduce their work week from 40
  hours a week to 30. And the way this worked was each workday, five days a week,
  would be 6 hours long and not 8 hours long.\n\nWell the experiment was done and
  as reported in the New York Times on May 21st, here are the results. Workers were
  much, much happier; workers were sick much less often; workers felt no need to retire
  early; and workers were more productive, so much so that the supervisors and employers
  in question felt that they gained more in the extra productivity in workers than
  they lost in the time. Yes, that’s right. An initiative from below, something opposed
  by the employer turned out to be better for everyone, even the employer, who opposed
  it.\n\nJust think what an economic system would be like that enabled, empowered
  and encouraged workers to have the initiative because they stood to gain from making
  conditions better for themselves. It is an important lesson."
