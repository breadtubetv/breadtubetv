title: Richard Wolff on Why Mergers Don't Benefit Consumers
description: "\"... many companies become fewer companies until they're just big enough
  and few enough to be able to get together at the golf course, play a few rounds
  and cut a few deals in order not to have to drop the prices, even after they've
  cut the costs. That's what typically happens and that's what mergers are all about.\"\n\nWatch
