  E13] Sexual Assault \n\nIn the full episode, Dr. Fraad explores sexual harassment
  and sex abuse, particularly in the US. Sexual assaults have been a perk of male
  power seemingly forever. This podcasts asks why sexual abuse has been a perk of
  male power and why women are are daring to call it out now. Dr. Fraad looks at the
  issue through a Marxian lens which clarifies so much about why: why is it everywhere
  and why is it now confronted and condemned?\n\nFollow us ONLINE: \nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/capitalismhitshome\nWebsites:
