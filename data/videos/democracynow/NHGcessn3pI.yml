  this episode, we sat down with Kali Akuno — the co-founder and co-directer of Cooperation
  Jackson. We discuss the emerging network of worker-owned cooperatives and the people
  behind it building an alternative, solidarity-based economy inside the majority-black
  and impoverished city of Jackson, Mississippi.\n\nIn Jackson Rising, Akuno helps
  chronicle the history, present and future of one of the most dynamic yet under-documented
  experiments in radical social transformation taking place in the United States.
  The book follows the surprising story of the city’s newly elected Mayor, Choke Antara
  Lumumba, whose vision is to “encourage the development of cooperative businesses”
  and make Jackson the “most radical city on the planet.”\n\nIn the first part of
  the interview, we ask Akuno about the ongoing organizing and institution building
  of the black, working-class political forces concentrated in Jackson dedicated to
  advancing the “Jackson-Kush Plan.” \n\nWe then diver deeper into the different types
  of worker-owned cooperatives that makeup Cooperation Jackson; the importance of
  developing cooperatives with clear political aims; and the need for a nationwide
  network of cooperatives and solidarity economic institutions as a viable alternative
  to the exploitative nature of our current economic, social, and environmental relations.\n\nCooperation
  Jackson is one of the most important stories for those of us struggling for social
  justice, for human emancipation and self-determination, and for a solidarity economics
  as a base for working class political struggle and the fight against the systematic
  economic strangulation.\n\nPick up a copy of Jackson Rising: The Struggle for Economic
