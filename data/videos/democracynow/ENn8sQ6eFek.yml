  Understanding Marxism\n\nThis special edition of \"Economic Update\" is devoted
  to Understanding Marxism, the title of a short new book just published by Democracy
  at Work. Today's program, like the book, explains Marxism's systemic insights into
  capitalism now. We discuss Marxism's basic criticisms of capitalism and also its
  complex relationship to socialism. Finally, we offer a survey of the last century
  of Marxism's huge, diverse influences on modern economics, politics and culture
  around the world.\n\nRead full transcript here: https://www.democracyatwork.info/eu_understanding_marxism\n\nFollow
