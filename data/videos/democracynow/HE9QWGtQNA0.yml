title: 'PRF Review: A Joke That''s True'
description: |-
  President Trump jokes about the possibility of trading Puerto Rico for Greenland. If this shocks you, host Andrew Mercado-Vázquez wants you to know that the US Government has already looked at the option, or at least has acknowledged the option, of ceding Puerto Rico to another nation state in a 2005 Presidential Task Force Report. That's part of the reality of Puerto Rico's colonial condition.

  "When President Trump apparently jokes about the possibility of trading Puerto Rico for Greenland, it's a real possibility. That really is a possibility and that is the insanity that is fostered by a colonial condition... We really need to inform the general population of the US about what the colonial condition allows, the injustices that are fostered under such a a colonial condition. The ignorance of the US voting population is one of the main contributors to sustaining Puerto Rico's colonial situation." - Andrew Mercado-Vázquez
