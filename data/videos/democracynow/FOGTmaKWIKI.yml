  A patron of Economic Update asks: "Prof. Wolff, It seems to me that the spread of WSDEs would be greatly helped by the creation of some kind of member-owned "socialist bank" that would provide the capital for suitably-skilled workers to start their own democratic enterprises. There could be democratic input by the by the bank's member-owners as to what projects should receive funds, and in exchange they could receive a return on their loans, split with the bank, so that it could grow and expand its mission. What do you think of that idea, and if you support it, could you please talk about it on your show? It beats waiting around for public banking or for corporate banks to take a liking to worker-owned cooperatives."
