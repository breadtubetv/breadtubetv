title: Richard Wolff gives a brief world survey of Marxism
description: "\"I wanted to do a brief, bold, and highly incomplete survey of what
  Marxism has done already in the way of shaping modern culture, influencing modern
  ways of thought. It’s a much more pervasive and deeply ingrained way of thinking
  than many people recognize, and to that end I want to do this brief survey. Some
  of the names I'm going to mention to you are known very well, others are almost
  unknown. It's the breadth, the depth, the range of people whose work is influenced
  by Marxism that I want to underscore.\"\n\nWatch entire episode:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENn8sQ6eFek&list=PLPJpiw1WYdTMLIyASxEheOVjl1vKkajYj&index=9\n\nWe
