  Mathew-Shah is President of Progressive Workers Union (PWU) and currently employed
  with the Sierra Club as an International Environmental Justice Representative. As
  a non-profit employee for over seven years, Neha has experienced the power of working
  with a union to build a powerful, equitable and inclusive environment both inside
  and outside the workspace. At Sierra Club, this change has been driven by two unions
  that represent the two-thirds of the organizations employees, PWU and Sierra Employee
  Alliance (SEA)."
