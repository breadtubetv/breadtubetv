title: 'Economic Update: Capitalism in Denial'
description: "[S9 E35] Capitalism in Denial\n\n**We make it a point to provide the
  show free of ads. Please consider supporting our work. Become an EU patron on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/economicupdate\n\nThe
  first half of this week’s episode of Economic Update features a discussion by Professor
  Wolff on the parallels of declining capitalism in the UK and the U.S. and how the
  denials of the systemic problems inherent with capitalism are making the economic
  situations in both countries profoundly worse.\n\nIn the second half of this week’s
  show, Professor Wolff presents two longer segments on (1) the political economy
  of immigration, and (2) why the basic problem of Central and South America is 2-3
  centuries of capitalism producing and reproducing extreme inequality, staggering
  poverty, and corrupt government elites. That is the crucial context for the Cuban
  and Venezuelan efforts, however imperfect and against U.S. opposition, to break
  out of capitalism.\n\nFollow us ONLINE: \nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/economicupdate\nWebsites:
