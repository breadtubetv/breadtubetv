title: 'WIN Short: Iowa Cartoonist Fired for Speaking the Truth'
description: "This special feature is produced by Democracy at Work for Workers Independent
  News (laborradio.org).\n\nThis is Richard Wolff for Democracy at Work.  I want to
  tell a story that is about America today but it is not about workers and factories
  or offices or stores. It’s about farmers and they are workers too and there news
  is important for us and never more than at this moment. I want to tell a story about
  Rick Friday. He is a cartoonist; he makes cartoons for the Farm News, a news services
  that goes to many, many farmers in the state of Iowa, very famous there. He has
  been a cartoonist for that services, for that news paper, for 21 years. He started
  in 1995, he is very well liked very well admired, very much a fixture for Iowa farmers.
  \ \n\nWell on the 29th of Aprils the paper published a cartoon that he had made.
  And I am going to tell you what the cartoon said and then tell you what happened
  to Mr. Friday.  But, maybe to wet your appetite I’ll tell you what happened to Mr.
  Friday, he got fired. \n\nHere was his cartoon, it showed two farmers in overalls
  wearing baseball caps chatting at a fence. The first one said, “I wish there was
  more profit in farming”. The second one replies, “There is in the year 2015 the
  CEOs of Monsanto, Dupont Pioneer and John Deer Tractor combined to make more money
  than 2129 Iowa farmers.”\n\nSomebody complained to the management and the next day
  Rick Friday was fired after 21 years. It seems that in Iowa as in so much of the
  United States, if you say the truth, if you say what everybody who is paying attention
  knows is the truth, you have violated some unspoken rule that we are supposed to
  pretend an economy and society falling apart, because of the gap between the rich
  and poor, is actually not doing anything of the sort.\n\nLearn more: www.democracyatwork.info\n---\nSpanish
