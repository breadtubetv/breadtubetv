title: 'EconoMinute: Banks and Car companies'
description: In this EconoMinute, Prof. Wolff discusses how banks and car companies
  have evaded the system, conducting business unethically and illegally. Banks have
  been found guilty of money laundering, manipulating interest rates, overcharging
  their customers.  Similarly, major automobile companies have falsified emissions
  tests, polluting the environment and compromising the health and safety of people.  When
  companies are driven by profits, they will stop at nothing to secure them.  He proposes
  worker coops as a viable solution to these systemic problems.
