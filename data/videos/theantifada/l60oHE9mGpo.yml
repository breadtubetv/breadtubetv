title: Ep 68 - FALC the System w/ Aaron Bastani
description: |-
  Novara Media's Aaron Bastani calls in to talk Brexit before we dive into Fully Automated Luxury Communism, the meme he created way back in the mid '10s, now a book available from Verso. What is luxury? Are we coming closer to FALC with each bite of the Impossible Whopper? Should it more appropriately be called FALKensyianism? Will the Green New Deal lead to FALC or continued late capitalist Dystopia? Bastani answers all these burning questions and more.
