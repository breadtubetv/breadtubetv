  community for as little as $2 a month at\nhttps://www.patreon.com/theantifada\n\nIf
  you thought last episode was arcane, get a load of this shit! We sit down with Ross
  Wolfe of https://thecharnelhouse.org to venture into the farthest, darkest reaches
  of left theory... in order to resurrect the nightmares of dead generations within
  the minds of our listeners. \nRoss discusses how Sean nearly came to blows with
  famous fashy troll Kantbot at a Verso Books party. \nJamie informs Sean that she
  thought he was a violent horror man when they first dated. \nWe debate the monetary
  value of a human rib if it's broken within a police riot and subsequent lawsuit.
  \nCrew gets down to discussing the political economy of architecture, the merits
  of grandiosity in construction and the mercenary optimism of high modernist internationalism.
  \nRoss explains the evolution of the #doom meme and origins of Yacht Communism.
  Antifada then does another deep dive into 20th century theory and practice in a
  wide-ranging discussion of anarchism, council communism, Bordiga, bourgeois barbarism
  and communization. \nWe all end up slightly depressed at the end, but in different
  and interesting ways. Remember: access to our Discord community is only $2/mo and
  the whole package - including voice chat and premium content - is a mere $5. We'd
  greatly appreciate any support you wanna throw our way. www.patreon.com/theantifada
