description: |-
  Once more into the breach! Matt Christman of Chapo Trap House joins Sean KB again to make history all the more weapony. In this episode, we discuss the 'controversial' French 'novel' that is 'just asking questions' about the Migrant Invasion and the Great Replacement

  How did a 1970s book by some grenouille asshole named Jean Raspail become a prophetic lodestar for an ascendant white nationalist movement? How does a historical materialist analysis help us understand why dickheads like Steve Bannon and Marine Le Pen are lauding this novel 50 years later? Ultimately, we ask wtf is up with French politics/development that they could vomit up filth so enduring as to still be 'relevant' in 2019?

  We read it so you don't have to...
