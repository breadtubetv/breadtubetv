  week on the Militant Minority Report, we get even more seditious than usual with
  the help of army resister Spenser Rapone (@punkproletarian).\n\nMike Ness of Social
  Distortion brings a smile to our faces. Spenser's journey from 18-year-old recruit
  to dank communist meme. The relationship between capitalism and imperialism: Is
  it even possible to oppose war without attacking the wage system? The pitfalls of
  knee-jerk anti-imperialism.\n\nA comparative history of resistance and mutiny during
  the Vietnam War and Portugal's Carnation Revolution, the latter of which overthrew
  a fascist government with hardly any violence. Andy Stapp's heroic efforts to unionize
  the US Army in the Vietnam era. Will anyone pick up the mantel?\n\nThe military
  as potential — even essential — site of class struggle, and the various factors
  working for and against that. Could a revolution ever happen here in the dark heart
  of the American empire, and if so, what would it look like? Lastly and most importantly:
  Was Spenser just trolling or does he really think communism will win?\n\nCheck out
