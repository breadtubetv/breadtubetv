  at the CUNY Grad Center and PSC union activist. \n\nHelp support the show and access
  premium content at\nhttps://www.patreon.com/theantifada\n\nGang talks Notorious
  F.F.P. (Francis Fox Piven) and Glen Beck's hate-on for her. \nWilson breaks down
  the true origins and political economy of frozen, alcoholic street drinks. \nWe
  all lament, as usual, that NYC is way lamer than it used to be. \nJamie spills more
  tea on the neoliberal nightmare of Ozy Fest. \nMore here: https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/a-neoliberal-nightmare-at-ozy-fest-2018-702600/
  \nGang gets down to the hidden history of the National Welfare Rights Organization
  of the 1960s-70s. How does capitalism shape the domestic sphere? How have people
  organized around reproductive labor? Should we demand wages for housework, or wages
  against housework?! Disruption of the status quo gets the goods off the shop floor,
  too! \nValerie Solanas feminism vs. $hillary KKKlinton feminism. \nWhat's the deal
  with all this Universal Basic Income talk? Should we be afraid that our Silicon
  Valley overlords are talking about it, or can there be a left UBI that doesn't result
  in the Hunger Games? \nSean rants about the calculation of human life in monetary
  terms. \nJamie rants about how Laura Loomer deserves no respect, let alone any Jewish
  lawyer boyfriends. \nWilson confesses to getting cockblocked by Marxist feminism
  on a romantic evening with a hot firefighter.\n\nFollow the AF crew on Twitter:
