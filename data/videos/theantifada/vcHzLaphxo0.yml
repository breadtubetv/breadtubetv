  royal wedding. The US media's problematic framing of the most recent killings in
  Gaza. \nAngela Davis on the violence of the status quo. The uncounted millions who've
  met premature deaths due to the predations of capitalism. The connection between
  racist police murders, private property and the capitalist state. Why simply reforming
  the police and prison system is not enough. \nWhat kind of violence should the left
  be willing to entertain in service of social change? The depressing facts of social
  reproduction and the revolutionary possibilities of love. \nAre you a bad anarchist
  if you don't fuck everyone? \n\nThe Antifada's first on-air marriage proposal! \n\nPre-order
