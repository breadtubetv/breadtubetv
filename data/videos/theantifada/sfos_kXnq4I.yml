  community for as little as $5 a month at\nhttps://www.patreon.com/theantifada\n\nIn
  this very conspiratorial episode, the crew is joined by Tanz, writer, researcher,
  and PhD candidate in the CUNY Grad Center's social psychology program, to talk about
  a pamphlet she co-authored, \"How to Overthrow the Illuminati.\"\n\nAlex Jones,
  David Icke, 9/11 truthers, and the mainstreaming of conspiracy theories. The flat
  earth people make tankies of us all. Why do working class people believe in the
  Illuminati and other conspiracy theories? Gothic Marxism gets an extraterrestrial
  update. How to help people figure out the real problem is (spoiler alert!) capitalism
  without being an alienating weirdo about it.\n\nWe were going to discuss an article
  on structural anti-Semitism by Moishe Postone, but we ran out of time. Read it here,
  and/or demand Sean give you the Cliff's notes version in the next History is a Weapon.\n\n\"How
  to Overthrow the Illuminati.\"\nhttps://overthrowingilluminati.wordpress.com/\n\n\"Anti-semitism
  and National Socialism\" by Moishe Postone\nhttps://libcom.org/library/anti-semitism-national-socialism-moishe-postone\n\nAntifada
