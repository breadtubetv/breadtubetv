title: Episode Fourteen - BowieMusk 2020 w Niral Shah & Alex Gendler
description: "This week we are joined by returning guest Niral Shah (@NiralShah) and
  Soviet agent Alex Gendler (@Romanovs100) to talk music and Musk. (No Andy this week...he's
  away at commie camp polluting his mind with cultural Marxism.) \n\nNazi numerology.
  Abolish ICE, but only after one last special deportation. \nEpic hangovers. A highbrow
  review of the David Bowie exhibit at the Brooklyn Museum with an emphasis on his
  coke spoon and dick. Bowie's cultural appropriation and whether the political economy
  of music can even produce rockstars anymore. \n\nThis Week in Musk: our favorite
  extremely-online capitalist thinks every British expat in Thailand is a pedo. (Plausible,
  but problematic.) Free speech for the rich. Niral goes contrarian af and makes a
  rousing defense of Musk's merits. Alex recalls his time as a wealthy tech bro's
  garden hermit. \n\nJamie reveals that Skrillex is a short, insecure nerd IRL. Our
  new Silicon Valley ruling class are all Skrillexes. \n\nWhy is there an app to disrupt
  the key? Why? Why the FUCK?  Jamie plays us out with a rousing rendition of Grimes'
  \"Oblivious.\" \n\nBecome a patron starting at just $2/month to unlock rewards like
