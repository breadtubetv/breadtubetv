  guest canceled so Jamie picked up a rando at the DSA convention to fill in. Thanks
  for being such a good sport, rando! Jamie and the rando — whose name, it turns out,
  is Andrew Callaway — recap a bit of what went down at the convention, including
  a \"turn-to-industry\" proposal and a spicy debate around Bernie 2020. \nThe gang
  tackles the van attack in Toronto, the \"incel rebellion\" and why dudes who can't
  get laid and complain about it online are a kind of hate group. The political economy
  of angry young misogynists and what to do with them. How to keep those on the fence
  from turning into Pepes? Jamie's personal story of educating someone. \nThe impact
  of technology on sex and dating (Sean shows his age). \nWhy everyone will have better
  sex under socialism. Some social reproduction and historical materialism talk, because
  why not? \n\nWhy Women Had Better Sex Under Socialism by Kristen R. Ghodsee\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/12/opinion/why-women-had-better-sex-under-socialism.html\n\nCheck
