  community for as little as $5 a month at\nhttps://www.patreon.com/theantifada\n\nAfter
  our intended guests fell through, we were surprised and pleased to be joined by
  Comrade Communicator of the Intergalactic Workers League, who was inspired to appear
  by the troubling news of Trump's weird Space Force proposal.\n\nSeems dumb, but
  how about the extraterrestrial militarization of Ronny Raygun? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMfmVzHZvkc\n\nNext,
  in a Marxist-Ufologist version of Crossfire, AP Andy faces off against our guest
  in ideological combat over the legacy and relevance of 20th-Century Argentine socialist
  thinker and head of the Latin American section of the 4th International, J Posadas.
  The situation gets tense between the two as the historical tradition of heterodox
  Trotskyism confronts the new synthesis of Comrade High Commander's Neo-Posadism.\n\nWas
  Posadas a total wackjob or was there continuity between his ideas and the catastrophism
  of Leon Trotsky? Is the popularity of Internet Posadist memes a reflection of deeper
  world-historical forces or mere revisionism? How did Cuban Trotskyists under the
  influence of Posadas give birth to nuclear accelerationism? Will socialism arise
  out of proletarian self-organization or through the intervention of that vanguard
  that stands outside of history: the extraterrestrial Space Comrades?\n\nGang dives
  into the famous Posadas Flying Saucers communique: https://www.marxists.org/archive/posadas/1968/06/flyingsaucers.html\n\nAndy
  counterposes his own Marxist-Ufology research: https://theoutline.com/post/5384/the-secret-history-of-marxist-alien-hunters?zd=1&zi=jg4c3k6q\n\nAs
  always on Antifada, the most pressing issues facing humanity are addressed: water-birth
  and the 'New Socialist Man'; poly-Posadism vs volcel-Socialism; first contact and
  Enemy Alien Propaganda; the abolition of time as a transitional program; proletarian
  prepperism; and the necessity of uniting with dolphins, our class brothers and sisters
  of the sea.\n\nStay tuned for a special bonus episode, for patrons only, of Real
  Posadas Hours with IWL-P's Comrade Communicator. And always remember: David Ickism
  and Alex Jones Thought are the Posadism of fools!\n\nBecome a supporter of The Antifada
