  community for as little as $2 a month at\nhttps://www.patreon.com/theantifada\n\nJamie,
  Sean, and Andy are joined by militant documentarian Brandon Jourdan of https://www.globaluprisings.org.
  Brando discusses life as an expat, the indymedia network, and his four seconds of
  fame in Boots Riley's smash hit \"Sorry to Bother You.\" \nThe crew plays clips
  from Brando and his partner Marianne Maeckelbergh's films on uprisings in Spain,
  Turkey and the US. Does Brando see himself as part of these movements or just another
  slack jawed servant to the spectacle? \nThe causes of, and potential solutions to,
  right-wing populism around the world. Fascists all have permanent clown wigs: why?
  Brando breaks down right-populism in the Netherlands and why Geert Wilders is a
  loser. \nJamie and Sean's respective run-ins with Geert Wilders and Brexit-boy Boris
  Johnson. \nSean goes on one of his trademark rants about why capitalism is in crisis
  and will stay that way for the rest of its (hopefully numbered) days. \nThe limits
  of liberal multiculturalism. \nJamie throws Queen Hill Dawg a rare bone. Adam Smith's
  theory of \"truck, barter, and exchange\" is Fakenews. SAD! Brando's sweeping vision
  for how we can BE THE REV and create a new world in 17 easy steps. \n\nCheck out
