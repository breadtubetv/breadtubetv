title: 'Ep 40: Fully Automated Luxury Gay Space Communism w/ Kim Stanley Robinson'
description: |-
  Are you a nerd like us? Do you read stories about robots and space, while also pondering a socialist future? Well, do we have an interview for you...

  Fellow science fiction fanatic Will Menaker (Chapo Traphouse) joins Sean and Jamie for an extended discussion with one of our favorite utopian futurists, Kim Stanley Robinson. Come for the revolutionary potentialities of the post-capitalist imaginary and stay for the psychedelic polyamory!

  Outro - Hawkwind: Space is Deep
