title: 'History is a Weapon #4 w/ Matt Christman: Pivotal Decade (1970s)'
description: "(This is a PREVIEW of our two part, 3 hr+ histomatraveganza about the
  '70s. Full episode available for patrons here:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/posts/antifadas-is-4-w-27156700\n\nPatrons
  get access to our discord community and all our bonus material, including History
  is a Weapon, Jamie and Leslie Lee III's Vampire Castle, and Andy's Proletkult. Thank
  you for your support!)\n\nThe boys are back! This History Is A Weapon is so massive
  (and inebriated) that we had to break it into two parts. \n\nIn this installment,
  Matt and Sean shoot a little shit about the radical geography of Europe before we
  plunge into the pool of disco and despair that was the 1970s: how the global crisis
  upended the 'Golden Age' of American capitalism, how Richard Nixon rode a wave of
  aggrievement to become the voice of a 'silent majority' in backlash, and how the
  uneasy alliance between organized labor and the Democratic Party began to fracture
  as stagflation undermined the post-war compromise.\n\nPart II, another goddamn hour-and-a-half
  of historical goodness, will drop later this week to complete the story of how this
  thing called neoliberalism came to dominance, how it, too, is now crumbling, and
  how we might dialectically overcome the limitations of working class self-organization
  evident in previous cycles of struggle."
