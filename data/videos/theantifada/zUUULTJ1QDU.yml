title: Ep 55 - Power to the PLUR-letariat w/ Sophie Weiner
description: "Sophie Weiner, night-editor of Splinter News and displaced poster, was
  back in NYC for a bit. We got her in studio to talk about politics in Australia
  and other oddities... for example, something good happened in Albany for once! We
  were also gifted with another lovely morsel of #content from media power couple
  Bari & Bill Weiss-Maher.\n\nFor all episodes and access to our Discord commune visit
  https://www.patreon.com/theantifada\n\nMostly we had a fun discussion about electronic
  dance music (kids these days call it 'the raving') and how socialists can organize
  within the scene while inspiring our politics with the libratory potentials of it.
  All of this, of course, is anticipation of this week's publication of Sophie and
  Zoe Beery's new anti-capitalist dance music zine... PLURletariat. Enjoy!\n\nCheck
