  community for as little as $2 a month at\nhttps://www.patreon.com/theantifada\n\nThe
  AF crew takes on Jonathan Chait's recent word turd: the things he's wrong about
  re: \"the radical left,\" as well as the things he's right about but which are actually
  fine. \nWe discuss the latest labor uprisings in France and the ridiculous choice
  of Nazi lady vs. neoliberal POS...which leads to a spirited game of \"fuck, marry,
  kill\" complete with Justin Trudeau conspiracy theory. \nFinally we talk about the
  Dead Kennedys and Jello Biafra for some reason. \n\nSorry for the poor sound quality
  and delayed release schedule. We were planning to add onto the episode but our new
  set-up sounds more DIY than we'd like it to, so...yeah. \n\nRead Jamie's piece on
