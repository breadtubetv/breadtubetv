description: "Join the Antifada community to hear more spicy takes from this conversation
  (dropping later this week)! https://www.patreon.com/theantifada\n\nIn this very
  special Antifada offering, Andy, Jamie and Sean are joined by your favorite sons:
  Matt Christman and Virgil Texas of Chapo Trap House. Gang begins by addressing the
  central questions of our hyper-digital age: what if God friended you on Facebook?
  Is QAnon just a benign hobby for bored Boomers? And, holy shit, what if GOD WAS
  QANON? \n\nMatt, Virgil and Jamie reveal - for the very first time - their respective
  political tendencies. Everyone marvels at how high-T Jeb(!) managed to lose the
  primary despite the PR coup of offering a poorly branded guaca bowle. \n\nCrew get
  knee-deep into Paul Schrader's 1978 classic \"Blue Collar\" starring Richard Pryor,
  Yaphet Kotto and Harvey Keitel's genitalia. How does this movie about struggling
  union autoworkers help us understand the 70s as more than just bad hair and bell
  bottoms? (C.f. Jefferson Cowie's \"Stayin' Alive\" and the upcoming \"Chapo Guide
  to Revolution: A Manifesto Against Logic, Facts and Reason\") \n\nHow did the \"Golden
  Age\" of US capitalism break down? How the hell did we end up in neoliberal hellworld
  when the 70s saw the most massive wildcat strike wave since the 30s? Why can't we
  return to decadent late social-democracy complete with coke benders, shag carpets
  to bang across, crushed velvet noodie posters and modernist chairs made to look
  like cocks'n'balls? Ugh. \n\nAfter the depressing grind of Blue Collar, Matt suggests
  we lighten the mood with \"Gung Ho\" (1986) starring Michael Keaton. What's more
  uplifting after watching a film about declining racial solidarity among the US working
  class than one that uses stereotypes about the Japanese for cheap yuks? What's more
  laughable than watching a town full of autoworker rubes look to a washed up high
  school jock to solve their employment crisis? \n\nIn a startling twist, the entire
  crew turns on the American working class as the indolent, entitled chuds they are:
  you will all wear Ribbons of Shame in the highly disciplined and sadistic Japanese-dominated
  future! \n\nLuckily, this week's viral wildcat video by a Hero of Socialist Labor
  saves us from going full MAGA. Spoiler: in the end our various tendencies are synthesized
  into Antoine Dangerfield Thought. \n\nBecome a patron today to access more content
