  the punx! Jamie, Sean and guest Aaron Petcoff of the ISO discuss music, religion
  and sacred cows. \nWe talk shit on Fiverr. Sean confuses Epitaph with Hellcat records
  like an old idiot. Jamie revisits one of her childhood favorites. \nWe try nuance
  for the first time with regard to religion and socialism. We discuss our lame faves.
  Jamie cucks Sean thrice.\n\nFollow the AF crew on Twitter: \nhttps://www.twitter.com/the_antifada\nhttps://www.twitter.com/jamie_elizabeth\nhttps://www.twitter.com/spaceprole"
