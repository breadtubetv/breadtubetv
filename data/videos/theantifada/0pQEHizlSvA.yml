  The Antifada's HARD LAUNCH episode, Jamie and Sean speak with socialist power couple
  Doug Henwood and Liza Featherstone about aggression in Syria, the governor's race
  in New York, and liberal derangement syndrome. \nLiza does an on-air version of
  her socialist-feminist advice column in The Nation, \"Asking for a Friend.\" Jamie
  almost sells out, but mistakes ice cream for soap so w/e. \nSean reminds us that
  leftists don't make heroes of i-banking cops like James Comey. \nDoug and Liza talk
  about how they met and their philosophy on makin' red diaper bbs. Jamie and Liza
  admit they're only in it for the Bernie bro boyfriends.\n\nCheck out Doug Henwood
  at https://lbo-news.com and on his weekly radio show and podcast, \"Behind the News\":
