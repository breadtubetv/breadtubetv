description: |-
  Massive spoiler alert on this one, baby! @leslieleeiii of your favorite leftist culture podcast @strugglesesh joins the crew (in studio!) to talk about Jordan Peele's sophomore offering, the blockbuster social-critique/horror film 'Us'.

  Sean, Jamie and Andy offer their weird opinions on the deeper meaning of the film... then Leslie, as always, schools everyone with his vast cinematic knowledge. Fun and talking shit on Breitbart happens along the way!
