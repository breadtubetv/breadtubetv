title: This Is A White Supremacist Symbol
description: |-
  You may have seen the blue lives matter symbol on the back of people's cars, flying from people's from doors, and sporting from people's t-shirts. What you may not realize is that is that there is a violent legacy that it holds.

  (Goldwin's law claim: I realize before uploading that people may try to make this claim. However, I have done my homework on white supremacy and police violence for many years. I also gave voices to peoples of color so I feel that not only is my research qualified, but that we can't always cry "Godwin's law" anytime someone brings up white supremacy. Doing that is censorship and is controlling of the conversation. If you disagree with my points, please present your case and do so constructively - don't just cry "Godwin's law".)
