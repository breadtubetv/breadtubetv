  in this video is used in compliance with Fair Use Laws which reads as follows:\n\nNotwithstanding
  the provisions of sections 106 and 106A, the fair use of a copyrighted work, including
  such use by reproduction in copies or phonorecords or by any other means specified
  by that section, for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching
  (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research, is not
  an infringement of copyright. In determining whether the use made of a work in any
  particular case is a fair use the factors to be considered shall include—\n(1) the
  purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial
  nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;\n(2) the nature of the copyrighted
  work;\n(3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the
  copyrighted work as a whole; and\n(4) the effect of the use upon the potential market
  for or value of the copyrighted work.\nThe fact that a work is unpublished shall
  not itself bar a finding of fair use if such finding is made upon consideration
  of all the above factors.\n(Pub. L. 94–553, title I, § 101, Oct. 19, 1976, 90 Stat.
