title: I Dumped My Boss (Folk Song)
description: "I guess this is a new IWW song.\n\nLyrics\nMy boss grinds me to the
  ground\nWork all night I don’t make a sound\nSteals my labor and banks on my work\n‘see
  only a sliver but that’s just his quirk\n\nI don’t wanna live in a capitalist system\nWhere
  we work for the few in classist schism\nI’ll be free, with my friends, I’m tired
  of this shit\nToday’s the day told my boss I fucking quit\n\nhires more staff throughout
  the day\nCuts my hours and reduce my pay\nTold me to shoot a gun up my nose\nI fired
  on his clothes with my hose\n\nI don’t wanna live in a capitalist system\nWhere
  we work for the few in classist schism\nI’ll be free, with my friends, I’m tired
  of this shit\nToday’s the day told my boss I fucking quit\n\nI hope the company
  crumbles and smashes down\nMy boss better pack his bags and get outta town\nmy comrades
  and I are unionizing worker’s co ops and \nI would appreciate if I never had to
  see another landlord again\n\nMy Social Media\nDISCORD:  https://discord.gg/d2HXvrN\nPATREON:
