title: Top 5 Reasons YOU'RE AN IDIOT (For Supporting Trump)
description: "This took me 3 months of impotent liberal rage, sweat and tears - So
  you better like it. \n\nPay no attention to the poor audio, change of shirts, background,
  hair and lighting... or to the the fact that I'm Canadian and this doesn't really
  affect me in any way.\n\nSome of my dialogue is lifted from Sam Harris and others.\n\nNOTE:
  I am proud of this video as it put me on the map, but I want to apologize for using
  the word re***d. It is offensive and I regret having used it.\n\n**Ignore the part
  about the disabled reporter. Its not a valid point, HOWEVER, it does help demonstrate
  his immaturity as an adult."
