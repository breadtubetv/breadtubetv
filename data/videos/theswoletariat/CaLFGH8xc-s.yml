title: 'DEEP or DUMB? "Postmodern neo-Marxism" | Philosophy with Jeff #1'
description: |-
  Jeff McLaren has been running the Philosophy Hammer in Kingston, Ontario for nearly a decade. This is our first sit down discussion (hopefully of many) where I asked Jeff to look at a meme popularized by Jordan Peterson called "Postmodern neo-Marxism". In this conversation we find out how well Peterson's theory maps onto the works of actual postmodern philosophers.
