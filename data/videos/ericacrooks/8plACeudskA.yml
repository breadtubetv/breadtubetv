title: 'The Eric Crooks Show : Episode 17 ( 2007 )'
description: "The final episode from 2007 of The Eric Crooks Show created by Trans
  Woman filmmaker, comedian and puppeteer Erica Crooks .\n\nIf you think The Erica
  Crooks Show puppets look primitive , just take a look 9 years ago. \nThe very first
  film year of The Eric Crooks Show was in 2006 ( The Erica Crooks Show as of 2016
  )\nCelebrating 10 Years of Erica Crooks comedy filmmaking and puppet / cartoon satire.\n\nFor
  more information visit officialericcrooks.com today !\n\nA sketch in this show featured
  a character's\nreaction to a Transgender Heterosexual Woman\nnot understanding the
  fact that a Trans Woman\nIs a Woman who was born in the wrong body.\nThis was a
  product of it's time.\nAnd is included as a piece of Erica Crooks history.\nThis
  was made most likely in 2007.\nIronically 6 years later,\nErica realized she's in
  fact a Trans Woman Lesbian.\nDespite this sketch, this 2008 season would later\nexplore
  androgyny and the LGBTQ in a positive light.\nIn 2009, the show predicted Erica
  being a woman\nborn in the wrong body.\nHowever the sketch in this episode is more
  on the\nuneducated character's reaction and not so much on the Trans character\nwho
  didn't work on voice therapy.\nWe are sorry to anyone who is offended , but as you
  can see,\nlife out satired satire with irony on Erica's life\nshortly after this
  episode was made.\nAlso in one of the last episodes of the 2007 season.\nA sketch
  pointed out Erica slowly coming out."
