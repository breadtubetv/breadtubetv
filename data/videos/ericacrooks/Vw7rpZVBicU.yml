title: Spiritual Anarchism IS Anarchism and NOT Hierarchical ATTENTION FELLOW ANARCHISTS
description: "This video is in response to the many Anarchist YouTubers and Anarchists
  who claim that New Thought / New Age Spirituality / Law of Attraction / etc is hierarchical
  and a brainwashing tool for the mentally ill. I personally do not think so and I
  think that as Anarchists we should live people with differences in spirituality
  and even religion alone just as long as no one is getting hurt.\n\nhttp://anarchism.pageabode.com/afaq/secA3.html#seca37\n\n\nLaw
  of Attraction & Anarchism ,\nWhy not ?\n\nRelated Article :\nhttps://officialericcrooks.blogspot.com/2019/01/new-age-new-thought-spiritual-anarchism.html
