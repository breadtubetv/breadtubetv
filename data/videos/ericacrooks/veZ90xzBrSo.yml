title: King Ate All The Food ( 2013 )
description: |-
  After “ I Wah Ma Kawfee ! 2 : The Dumb Bikers “ was made , the next year Erica Crooks and a friend talked about an idea for a web series .
  Erica Crooks made a test cartoon however nothing came of the web series because Erica’s friend had a different vision for it so the web series never got made. The web series was going to be called “King and Friend” . The idea was after the death of “ King “ ( a rude overweight parody of Elvis ) passed away , a nerdy fan was very sad because he always wanted to be friends with him. But soon he realized that King faked his death to escape his career and was hiding out at his fan’s place. So King allows his fan to be his sidekick. However the fan soon realizes that King is more like Johnny Bravo then he is what the media says he was.

  The short test film featured King bringing his fan to a free restaurant in which he eats all the foot in the soup kitchen for the homeless .
  The beginning of the test short film can not be found , all that can be found is the ending scene which is this.
  The chief / cook looks like Dom Deluise .
