title: ENFP Social - We LOVE PEOPLE
description: |-
  ENFP Socializing : When a shy ENFP warms up quickly. Warming up quickly is an understatement. ENFP Personality Type is known for being not only very talkative ( sometimes never shutting up ) but also one of the most friendliest and warmest personality types EVER ! A true free spirit even when we have our sensitive moments or funny silly & rude sense of humor. And if you think ENFPs are crazy, I haven't even mentioned yet the ENTP personality type.

  For more ENFPness check out my ENFP as well as ENTP pages on officialericcrooks.com

  And yes, me Erica is an ENFP myself so I know what I'm talking about from life and personal experience. ;)
