description: "Yes there is a Transgender MTF Woman Lesbian political cartoonist satirist
  and humorist out there. And her name is Erica Crooks. \n\nIn this video Erica Crooks
  talks about how there's discrimination in editorial cartoons. So why can't like
  minded cartoonists with a sense of humor be open minded to talent. We are all different
  but share a similar sense of humor and interests and a love for art right ? Can't
  we all just get along and enjoy a good laugh at the world together ?\n\nFor more
  information on Erica Crooks,  visit the Official website on officialericcrooks.com\n\nAnd
  support LGBT right for comedy art expression today !\n\nWe aren't so different after
  all don't you agree ? We're human !"
