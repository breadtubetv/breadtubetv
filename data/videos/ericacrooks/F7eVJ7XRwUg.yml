  Puppets React To The Happytime Murders Trailer : Erica Crooks Edition

  Puppets react to The Happytime Murders Trailer is becoming a trend now on the internet.
  Which is funny because perhaps this is something that the rude satirical R rated puppets on
  The Erica Crooks Show should do. Not only are we also Muppet(r)(tm)(c) ( of Disney (tm) / Henson (tm) ) geeks and nerds
  but also we are a satirical puppet comedy web series that parodies stuff we care about.
  And since we’re kind of bummed out and confused that this Happytime Murders film is in fact a Brian Henson film ,
  instead of allowing our 1990s childhood go down the toilet as well as copying the cliche Puppets react to The Happytime Murders trailer trends and fads ,
  here’s a couple of highlights where we Puppets totally and satirically riff on The Happytimes Murders trailer.

  ( We are an independent puppet tribe that is influenced by the greats and channeled through the satirical , twisted , and creative imagination of Erica Crooks . And to all those capitalists out there , in no means is this copyright infringement / right to publicity because we don’t use any copyright material other than our own in this video.
  It is fair use under LAW ( bow up and down to hierarchy UGH blah blah blah ) because of freedom to comment and parody / satirize .
  Besides we didn’t have our freedom of speech and expression taken away….YET by The New World Order , anyway enjoy the video.
  And we’ll wait and see to find out of The Happytimes Murders is any good. Place your bets friends. We think this film is going to be a STINKER !


  ( The puppet parody also includes strong and sexual language )
