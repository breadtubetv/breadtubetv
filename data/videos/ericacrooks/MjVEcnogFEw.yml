title: 'Ableism : Satire vs Bullying'
description: "( Trigger Warning : Subject of Ableism )\n\nIn this video I wanted to
  talk about not only satire theory but also ableism ( discrimination of people with
  disabilities & mental illness )\nIn this video I talk about it in a general sense
  , more talking about disabilities.\n\nThere's a lot of discrimination towards people
  with disabilities . However satire / dark humor satire is known for subject matter
  that is taboo.\n\nIt's a good thing to be punching up instead of punching down.\n\nSatire
  is often a misunderstood art as well as literature , perhaps this is related with
  politics. Liberalism does it one way , however I am an Anarchist and a satirist.\n\nSo
  these are some thoughts regarding the subject of satire mentioning ableism for now.\n\n_
