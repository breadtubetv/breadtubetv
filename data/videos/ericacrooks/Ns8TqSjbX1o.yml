title: INFP Anarchists martyrs ? part 1
description: "Part 2 : https://youtu.be/L2nhbsx9JqM\n\n\n#infp #infps \n\nNo one can
  deny the polarization and division when it comes to politics more than ever which
  I don't necessarily see it to being a bad thing , similar to the 1960s , we can
  sometimes spot who the good people are vs the bad people. But of course the evil
  from the right isn't going to give up without a fight. In recent years more and
  more youtubers and bloggers teaching Libertarian Socialist Anarchism to New Thought
  / New Age Spirituality which maybe a great deal of INFPs leading the way of their
  lightworker mission I suppose , well relating to the saying \" As Above , So Below
  . \" In other words there's most certainly counter-protests going on from the right
  which includes but not limited to PragerU and even YouTubers that fully admit with
  no shame of being fascist bullies. \nRelating to this video , I've noticed specific
  words that are thrown at the left wing politically , many I often wonder are negative
  discriminating terms against INFPs such as butt hurt crybaby , special snowflake
  , social justice warrior ( SWJ ) , identify politics , agenda and in this video
  I will cover another one which is the words \" martyr \" and \" martyrdom \" . Even
  though \" martyr \" and \" martyrdom \" like \" agenda / dogma / etc \" may not
  be Right Wing invented words or perhaps none of them are , they are most certainly
  used against the left wing political supporters and perhaps like the Goth stereotype
  even INFPs as well. Perhaps even Anarchists. \n\nSo that's the question. Are INFPs
  and or Anarchists Martyrs ?\nI personally didn't educate myself enough about that
  word but here's my thoughts about all of this if that debate itself be the case.\n\n_
