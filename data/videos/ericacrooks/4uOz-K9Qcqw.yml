title: Intuitive Bias is caused by Hierarchy
description: "iNuitive Bias is caused by Hierarchy , All political problems are.\nLeft
  vs Right , Intuitives vs Sensors , Introverts vs Extroverts ,\nPerceivers vs Judgers
  , Feelers vs Thinkers , liberals vs left wing progressives vs ( right wing ) libertarians
  .\nEquality doesn’t matter ignore the MBTI Myers Briggs Personality Type Test Indicator
  all together.\nHierarchy simply means power over others.\nIn an Anarchist Society
  / 5D Earth we could either use MBTI and many other methods such as the self determination
  theory\nand law of attraction to know we can create our own life without anyone
  telling us what to do as well as understanding one another’s differences\nin a positive
  humanitarian light .\nHierarchy probably created the sensor dominated world which
  is the very isolation that develops so called “ iNtuitive Bias “ in the first place.\nSometimes
  sensors need to learn from the intuitives ‘ point of view and if they truly dislike
  intuitives , know there’s a secret door to escape ( what was once referred to an
  unrealistic idealist utopia that’s actually TRUE ) for them too .  \nHappiness is
  for everyone !\n\n #mbti #myersbriggs #infp #infps #anarchy #anarchism #anarchist
