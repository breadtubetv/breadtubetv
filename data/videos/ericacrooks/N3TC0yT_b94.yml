title: Anarchism NEEDS Spirituality and vise versa , working hand in hand just like
  the 1960s
description: "Anarchism NEEDS Spirituality and vise versa , working hand in hand just
  like the 1960s\n \nAtheism & Anarchism have been traditional . However I do not
  think New Thought / New Age Spirituality is hierarchical. How can one say that the
  paranormal is unscientific just because it doesn't fit 100% into what I consider
  hierarchical which is \" REALISM \" and \" Logical \" . This is probably why I'm
  also in favor for 5D Earth , because 3D Earth limitations is hierarchical scientific
  limits which might be eliminated in the a 5D Earth , maybe.   \n\nLikewise whatever
  is considered \" Hierarchical \" should be measured in intellectualism and perhaps
  intuitive personality types as well as universal agreement. And if there's one person
  on the planet that says no , they should be listened to and as well as re-educated
  if it's relating to their own perception and not necessarily universal humanity
  as a whole. \n\nI talk about this in this video and how things like spirituality
  and intellectualism could help out a social revolution .\n\nSo if your a left wing
  anarchist , I'd really like you to watch this video and think about the point of
  view that I point out.\n\nI'm not shoving my opinions down anyone's throat , in
  fact I'm just saying that before there's a collective agreement , it's good to listen
  even if the one person stands firmly alone .\n\n_ Erica\n\n\n#anarchy #anarchism
