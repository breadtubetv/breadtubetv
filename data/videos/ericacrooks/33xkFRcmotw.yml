  is a platform owned by Google and strong armed often by its advertisers and the
  US government.\n\nThose who stand to lose every time Youtube has to cave in are
  its creators and viewers. No more. From December 10th to December 13th weâ€™re staging
  a walkout from the site.\n\nNo watch views, no uploads, no engagement. Just stay
  out of YouTube.\n\nLet us not give them anything for three days. YouTube is nothing
  without creators and viewers, whether they are commercially viable or not. Enough,
  is enough.\n\n\nFor those who are looking for my videos outside of YouTube , I would
  suggest the following.\n\nErica Crooks non-YouTube Video Channels and other platforms
  that have my videos\n\nPeerTube : https://peertube.dk/video-channels/officialericcrooks1/videos\n\nDailymotion
