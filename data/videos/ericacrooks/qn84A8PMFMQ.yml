  remained and turned into sort of an audio movie which premiered on the second half
  of \" The Eric Crooks Audio Broadcast of Satirical Comedy : Pride and Political
  Satire \" http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/ericacrooks8\n\nA wonderful audio movie that's
  pro LGBTQ and at the same time a dark satire.\n\nFor more information on Erica Crooks
