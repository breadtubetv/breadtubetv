title: The Eric Crooks Show - Episode 9 ( 2007 ) Clip Show ( introduction only )
description: "This is just the intro of the show because the actual episode was just
  a clip show showing highlights from the first 5 episodes that make up Season 1 (
  2006 ). So this introduction was the only separate content. Plus it's a change to
  look at one of the very first and only opening sequences. And speaking of only,
  this was the ONLY clip show. From late 2007 / 2008 , various episodes had repeating
  sketches due to the public access show run and web show run just to be able to deliver
  a weekly or biweekly show. The show would end up being every month to every other
  month. \n\nFor more information on the show , check out the Official Erica Crooks
  website on officialericcrooks.com TODAY !"
