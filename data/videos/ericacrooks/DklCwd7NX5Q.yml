description: "Spitting Image / Les Guignols : History and American Revivals\n\nNews
  broke out from the BBC / BBC Arts that A NEW Spitting Image pilot was filmed and
  brand new Spitting Image puppets were made including Mark Zuckerburg , Kanye West
  , The Royals , Vladimir Putin ( as a small hand and rod puppet similar to David
  Steel ) and of course a EVEN MORE OUTRAGEOUS President Donald J Trump puppet EVEN
  more hilariously gross than the Les Guignols De L'info puppet. \n\nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-49865406\n\n\nThere
  has been news regarding “ AMERICAN “ versions of Spitting Image and Les Guignols
  De L’info ( canceled in 2018 ) .\nSpitting Image being revived by NBC \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7eR7-xUdhQ\n\nand
  Les Guignols being revived by FOX under the supervision of Robert Smigel . https://www.bubbleblabber.com/puppet-news-robert-smigel-producing-les-guignols-puppet-series-ron-burgundy-debuts-a-ventriloquist-act/\n\n\nThe
  United Kingdom / France / Europe are known for their leftist and satire tradition
  unlike America with the acceptation of Mad Magazine . Dinosaurs in my opinion was
  the only satire / satirical puppet show that was even close to leaning leftist from
  time to time. American satirists are for the most part right wing libertarian /
  centrist / and occasionally liberal .\n\nSpitting Image in it’s heyday had the traditional
  leftist satirist vibe while going more liberal and turning into kind of a SNL entertainment
  like show during it’s final years including doing an advert for the Libertarian
  Party before they retired.\n\nLes Guignols De L’info has been the strongest Spitting
  Image inspired show . They were very leftist , even rougher and darker than Spitting
  Image , had a bigger budget than Spitting Image and lasted for 30 years.\n\nIf an
  American Spitting Image / American Les Guignols became possible , the big question
  to ask is …\n( 1. Would it be made by the original team like the original 3 NBC
  pilot specials in the 1980s ( Down and Out from The White House , The Ronnie and
  Nancy Show , The 1987 Movie Awards ) as well as the American dubs of Les Guignols
  sketches before it’s cancelation seen on Dailymotion https://www.dailymotion.com/theguignols/videos
