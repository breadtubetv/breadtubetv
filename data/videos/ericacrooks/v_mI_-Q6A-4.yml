  Parody Comedy Halloween Special Show Thing )\n\nhttps://youtu.be/v_mI_-Q6A-4\n\n\"
  For those who remember , I've done two Halloween Shows in 2006 and 2007. I'm a fan
  of The Simpsons' Treehouse of Horror specials so that probably inspired me to do
  a similar tradition. Special episodes like that tend to be very tough for me , same
  with plot shows which is probably why I either abandon such projects or I start
  one and have a hard time finishing it for whatever reason and just shorten it. \n\nThere
  was this short under 10 minute Halloween cartoon around 2010 / 2011 that was never
  seen except a few friends privately at a home halloween party ( if I want to call
  it that lol ) ,  I did but it got trapped in a dead hard drive which I don't know
  if I still have or I deleted it by mistake thinking it was just a draft.\n\nI did
  have plans for a Halloween Special in 2015 which ended up being sort of a disaster
  because I was filming the making of the special at the same time and trying to beat
  the clock last minute a month or two ahead of time , just me doing it as usual.
  And footage was filmed and a sound track was recorded but I just ran out of time.
  lol The footage unfortunately got on the same files and stuff with the making footage
  and the audio I found recently so maybe eventually I do something with that on a
  later date . All I ended up editing I uploaded awhile back and they weren't even
  Halloween themed sketches. It was a Newscaster cold opening , a Westboro Baptist
  Church satire and Con & Spy Rotten going to the Time Out Room.\n\nThis time was
  similar to the 2015 show where I was trying to push myself to do a full legnth thing
  but ended up running out of time. A longer soundtrack was recorded which I'll probably
  do something with at later times. And I just didn't have time to compose music or
  sound effects . Plus I've been having some major technical difficulties with my
  computer so perhaps it's time to save for a new one. lol\n\nSo I decided to just
  take the remaining footage and turn it into this one minute thing , which is mixed
  with Halloween themed stuff / parodies / satires / pop culture topical gags / Which
  is clearly inspired by the tombstone gags from the early Classic Simpsons Treehouse
  of Horror specials. lol But my own spin on it I suppose.\n\nIt is what it is so
