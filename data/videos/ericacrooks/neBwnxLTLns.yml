  A political satire on hierarchical scare tactic CHURCH

  In Early 2013 , Erica Crooks had an idea for an animated / puppetry adult satire sketch dark comedy film in the tradition of satirical comedy sketch films like Tunnel Vision , Groove Tube , The Kentucky Fried Movie , And Now For Something Completely Different, Monty Python and The Meaning of Life .
  The film was going to be called “ Lost In The Frat Boy’s Locker “ . Even though the project was abandon , footage was animated and filmed.

  Existing footage was edited together with some storyboard animatics related to footage that was lost and or unanimated.
