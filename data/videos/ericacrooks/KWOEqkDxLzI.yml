title: Erica Crooks Adult Puppeteer & filmmaker reacts to and opinions on The Happytime
  Murders trailer
description: "As a lifetime Jim Henson fan , expert as well as an adult puppetry independent
  filmmaker and puppeteer . Yes I do have many opinions about Brain Henson’s new movie
  The Happytime Murders , intellectually and not just out of black and white reaction
  like most people on the internet. Still a movie is like a book , all we’ve seen
  is the cover. Will it be the next Brain Henson classic , is it worthy in Jim’s company’s
  name , will it be honored with all the other adult puppetry classics such as Dinosaurs
  , Meet The Feebles , Spitting Image , Les Guignols De L’info , and Puppets Who Kill
  ? Or would it end up as just as much of a dumb down low brow shock comedy as the
  trailer and tv spots present to generate box office from the masses. Well here’s
  the thing , when I see an adult puppet anything I expect it to be at least satirical
  or have some sort of structure because it’s like any literature , just with puppets
  for an adult audience. And when I see the name “ Brian Henson “ , yes indeed I do
  expect THE BEST QUALITY MOVIE EVER just like the 1990s Muppet movies he directed
  which has a special place in my heart and childhood. We will just have to wait and
  see. Either way , I wish The Jim Henson Company good luck. But telling by the trailer
  , looks like they are going to need it because most Muppet / Henson fans are SHOCKED
  and feel like this trailer is a slap across the face. Even ToughPigs thinks it’s
  “ desperate “. It’ll be nice to eventually see just what Frank Oz thinks of it.
  \ But in the meantime , here’s my two cents.\n\nWatch part 2 right here \n\nhttps://youtu.be/-gjPVol3bUM\n\nFor
