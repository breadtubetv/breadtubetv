description: "Internet Capitalism #NetNutrality #SaveTheInternet\n\nAnarchists , Introverts
  , INtuitives & The Left Unite ,\n#infp #infps Fellow INFPs , Lightworkers etc\n
  EVERYONE !\nThe Internet has been a best friend to you more than most people you
  ever knew.\nIt has to me.\n\nA technology that you can do anything , anywhere ,
  and anything …\nYou can learn Law of Attraction and manifest mostly great things
  in your life if you want.\nYou can learn about Anarchism and learn the truth of
  what’s really going on , what mainstream television would never mention unless they
  want to put it down.\nMaybe , just maybe , you realize that your not attracted to
  feminine woman romantically \nBut your attracted to Butch Lesbians ! Even though
  you know that you were born in the male body , you compare yourself to your fellow
  men and you feel deep down in your soul that perhaps you are one of the girls. \nSure
  , maybe you are not 100% feminine and Barbie like.\nYou are kind of an androgynous
  tomboy ….\nPerhaps you realize your Androgyne / Genderqueer \nHowever you know there’s
  something within you.\nYou see a Butch and Femme lesbian couple and what you would
  give to be the Femme and have a nice , masculine butch lesbian love you as if you
  where her girl.\nMaybe you look up the subject of Transgender Woman after meeting
  one , and you realize that yes , Transgender Women can be androgynous as well as
  lesbian just like cisgender women because women are women no matter what.\nPerhaps
  you meet some transgender men friends and see things from the other side of the
  street , perhaps you meet nice Gay men , perhaps nice cisgender heterosexual men
  , maybe that puts your mind / body and soul at ease realizing that not all men are
  like your abusive father.\n\nOk , perhaps I’m sprinkling my own life experience
  as well as the possibilities of someone else in a similar situation like me who
  used the internet that helped their life / personal growth / and spiritual growth
  and even coming out of the closet !\n\nThe point I’m making is , \nYOUR NOT ALONE
  !\n\n\nHierarchy only wants to have power over us and our human needs !\n\nEver
  heard of The Self Determination theory ?\nhttps://positivepsychologyprogram.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/self-determination-theory-three-needs.png\n\nOr
  how about Maslow’s pyramid of human needs ?\n\nhttps://pandsidentity.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/800px-maslows_hierarchy_of_needssvg.png\n\nNow
  what if hierarchical power if it’s \nThe New World Order , The richest of the capitalists
  that work in the state from The Queen to Trump !\n\nPerhaps it’s not really the
  who , but the what !\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmlJh8fThyE\n\n\nWhich is
  hierarchy ,\n\nFor more information I strongly recommend The Anarchist FAQ !\n\nhttp://anarchism.pageabode.com/afaq/index.html\n\n\nIsn’t
  it interesting how The Internet is really for the people and how we can make our
  own website and even our own TV channel through YouTube or DailyMotion or Vimeo
  or even on our own website , YET those freedoms might fade away.\n\n\nThe FCC might
  just want to turn the internet into a streaming media player and that’s it.\n\nWe
  just can’t go the liberal root and put our differences and try to get along.\nI’ve
  tried really hard to think that way.\nBut you know , that feels like someone who
  hasn’t escaped an abusive relationship controlled by narcissistic supply.\nThe sociopaths
  don’t just stop on the internet , the fascists don’t just stop in your local area
  ,\nThey have power over us.\n\nPerhaps it’s going to take a little bit of everything
  from everyone’s part in their own way to get rid of hierarchy / authoritative /
  totalitarian fascism ( aka Bullying ) .\n\n\nEven Love will conquer Hate and Fear
  . Someone will find a way as we are digging to find truth , We are stabbing at the
  ice to break through to get access to water underneath …\n\n\nJust remember the
  1960s , never lose hope ( even though a bunch of them sure did ) ,\n“ WE SHALL OVER
