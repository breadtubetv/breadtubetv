title: Anarchism and Spirituality
description: "I'm a spiritual , philosophical , cultural , and pacifist Anarchist
  and perhaps that makes me a minority of anarchists but I'm used to being the outcast
  , the nonconformist and the minority of minorities . I have noticed a divide between
  the social anarchists / libertarian socialist / anarcho-communist anarchists vs
  the other ones . But perhaps most of all , most Anarchists are atheist . A problem
  I tend to criticize is the whole \" science knows and confirms everything \" thing.
  It seems like if something can not be proven by science then it should be destroyed
  which I strongly disagree. Likewise if something was destroyed because it was hierarchical
  instead of being seen as a part of history's past of what people were like when
  living in hierarchy as well as measuring it's value and worth between if there's
  any non-hierarchical value in it. I think Spirituality is just judged as religion
  as being a tool of the ruling class to keep people obedient . I say that it's not
  hierarchical within itself which main purpose is to be liberating. Spirituality
  and Anarchism both share ( as I have expressed in previous blog videos and articles
  ) the philosophy of the liberated soul enjoying the most happiest and free life
  they can live . Unfortunately they can be against each other. Which is why I tend
  to talk about the subject of \" Spiritual Anarchism \" a lot. If Spirituality is
  nonsense then how can you explain all the mysteries and ironies of life ? There's
  beauty , love and light in Spirituality which is it's main purpose. _ Erica\n\n#spiritualanarchy
