title: Erica Crooks adult puppeteer talking about Dirty Puppets and part 3 of opinions
  about The Happytime
description: "Is Dirty Puppets doing adult themes and content actually funny at all
  ? Of course it is.\nI strongly feel that it’s all about how it’s done relative to
  two factors which is creativity ( imaginative ) and or satirical .\nSame goes with
  toilet humor and everything else. \n\nI talk about examples of this dirty adult
  humor with puppets from 2015 episodes of my Adult puppet comedy show “ The Erica
  Crooks Show “ \nas well as debating how the original uncensored humor of Jim Henson
  and his original crew probably were more creative with their dirty humor then what
  was seen in The Happytime Murders .\n\nI was going to see the film but after reading
  the reviews , it’s probably not worth the rush. Unfortunately I would have never
  thought I’d say that about a NEW Brain Henson film which I was just as excited as
  Star Wars fans before they seen Episode 1 about 20 years ago as I write this.\n\nAnd
  if you compare the adult humor of the original Jim Henson’s Muppets to Puppet Up
  / Stuffed and Unstrung / Happytime Murders / Henson Alternative Brain Henson’s Miscreant
  Puppets , and even comparing everything with Current Sesame Street vs Classic Sesame
  Street and Disney’s Muppets vs Jim Henson’s Muppets / Jim Henson Production Muppets
  1990s . It should be obvious. \n\nAnyway there’s my two cents on that .\n\n_ Erica
