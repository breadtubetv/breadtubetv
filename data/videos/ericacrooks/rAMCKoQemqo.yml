description: "Fellow INFPs , this video is for you . I cover things from my experience
  , things I’ve heard about regarding INFPs on the internet and perhaps even stereotypes
  of INFPs I bust . Remember , your not alone . And life can be wonderful if you allow
  it to be. Your all beautiful just the way you are. :)\n\nINFP : Wrong Planet ? Is
  INFP the most misunderstood personality type of Myers Briggs Personality Types ?\nIs
  INFP the most loneliest type not so much so a social life but perhaps being the
  #1 type who can care about humanity .\nIs INFP the most socially awkward unless
  interests are mentioned ? Is there a connection between INFP and Asperger’s Syndrome
  and other diagnoses from DSM Numerology ? Are INFP or some in fact light workers
  ? ( Which I’ve mentioned a bit in my video asking the question if INFP is considered
  to be the stereotype in the eyes of the public as a social justice warrior / special
  snowflake / butthurt crybaby ? )\nWould INFPs rather live in the world of fantasy
  and just HATE Earth life so much ? Are there political / spiritual / philosophies
  that not only make the world a better place but finally a utopia idea for INFPs
  and intuitives alike . INFPs , Intuitives and the MBTI Message Forum Online Community
  , how they are perceived . Mentioning a couple of famous successful people with
  the INFP Myers Briggs / MBTI personality type and more .\n\nPresented by INFP Trans
