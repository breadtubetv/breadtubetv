title: What if MBTI , Anarchism and Spirituality is TRUE and NOT Pseudoscience
description: "What if MBTI , Anarchism and Spirituality is TRUE and NOT Pseudoscience\n\nI
  often hear people debunking Myers Briggs Personality Type Science , New Age / New
  Thought Spirituality , Libertarian Socialist Anarchism , etc . \n\nBut if they think
  it's Pseudoscience , and I think that it's not Pseudoscience or it's Pseudoscience
  that's not fake at all ,\n\nIs this an argument among personality types ?\nAre there
  personality types that agree to this stuff more than others ?\n\nAre we living in
  a world of F types vs T types and therefore explains political problems and conflict
  ? \nMaybe not.\nThen again are there types closer to hierarchy than others ?\nPerhaps
  it's not so much the who but the what meaning behavior of hierarchy.\nMaybe it links
  together or it's completely separate.\n\nJust more ramblings for an INFP thinking
  about the conflict in the world , and perhaps to some people \" Overthinking about
  such theories and intuitive puzzle piece linking and creating conspiracy theories.
  \"\n\nIT is what it is. But is it hitting on some sort of \" Truth \" within the
  theory ? You be the judge."
