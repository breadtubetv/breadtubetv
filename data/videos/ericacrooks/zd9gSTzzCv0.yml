title: YouTube COPPA FTC vs Young at Heart , Arts , Culture & Left Wing politics
description: "YouTube / COPPA - Is The FTC using flak to slander the left and young
  at heart ? History of Culture and Art\n\n( The following video is expressed opinion
  like all of my videos …. Duh ! )\n\n( I don't think this video needs to be censored
  because it's all intellectualism expression and not much different from reading
  something on wikipedia , a book or even the news. ) \n\nConspiracy Theory OR TRUTH
  ?\n\nFirst Video : How YouTube / COPPA destroy the dreams of content creators https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBc7b6wnQA8\nSecond
  Video : They got a problem with adults who are young at heart https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msnCMFDCytw\n\nIn
  this video I am talking from an Anarchist protective. This situation is crazy. In
  the first two videos I talked about the situation .\nIn this video I talk about
  it further but also go deeper on why the YouTube / COPPA doesn’t make sense .\n\nMost
  people who are concern would most likely be liberals and right wing libertarian.
  However I’m coming from an Anarchist prospective.\nhttp://anarchism.pageabode.com/afaq/index.html
  ( For more info on Anarchism )\n\nThe ruling class runs the world globally including
  the United States Government. So why should a rich company like Google be worried
  about a $170 Million dollar lawsuit , that’s pocket change to the rich. NOTHING
  ! They can rule over the government if they wanted to ( and perhaps they do some
  form or another ) . That alone is suspicious . It’s even more suspicious where content
  creators need to follow the COPPA law on YouTube’s overly simplified terms which
  ARE IMPOSSIBLE and are questionable to just about anyone.\n\nTrump talked about
  how he wanted to get rid of anything left wing on the internet so IS THIS CONNECTED
  ? IF you were to separate what things relate to left leaning / liberal personalities
  vs what things lean toward right leaning personalities , then perhaps we are starting
  to see the big picture of what’s really going on.\n\nAnd how is this protecting
  children ? Why is content from adults who are young at heart ( pop culture fans
  , gamers , artists , movie and toy collectors , puppeteers / cartoon animators /
  entertainers / etc ) a threat to the lives of children ? WE ARE NOT ! We are living
  proof that this stuff can be enjoyed by adults.\n\nIf Religious Right activists
  ruled the FTC / COPPA then all of this would make more sense. IT’S ALL RIGHT WING
  REACTIONARY ! \n\nFurthermore what is dangerous to a child ? Many things that would
  be dangerous to an adult. Violence is evil and comes to mind as a crime against
  all living creatures. Hierarchy is violent , so is power over us “ Government ,
  Capitalist Ruling Class , etc “ …\nIn other words , how much sense does it make
  that The Government ( Imperialist Oligarchy ) runs the Online Children’s Privacy
  Protection Act under the Federal Trade Commission . THAT ALONE MAKES NO SENSE !\n\nYouTube’s
  COPPA polities are just the cherry on the most ignorant cake ever.\n\nLots of people
  are angry , lots of people will protest , YouTube / GOOGLE / COPPA / FTC would be
  foolish to NOT CAVE IN on mass protect due to them ignoring the public.\n\nSo it
  all comes down to this.\nRevolution or Brainwashed Slave , your choice !\nEither
  people can fight for their rights and what they love in life or be submissive to
  slavery. Fight or Slavery , the choice is yours . YouTube's backstabbing it's users
  is betrayal ! It's us against the cruel ruling class ! Power to the people not the
  people in power. REVOLUTION !\n\nAlso my friend MetalCoryM and his response to the
  YouTube / Coppa situation : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yKe1wfl8zA\n\n #anarchy
