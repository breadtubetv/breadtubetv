title: How this INFP satirist became an anarchist and how intuitives might be interested
description: |-
  In this video I talk about my personal attraction to anarchism as well as how Libertarian Socialism can be attractive to INFPs and maybe other intuitive personality types as well as how it can be good for LGBTQ+ people too. Iâ€™m a transgender lesbian woman by the way.
