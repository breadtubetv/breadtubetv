description: "These animation tests would eventually become the animated version of
  The Eric Crooks Show ( 2011 - 2012 )\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jt7yvEbCPk\n\nAlso
  includes the first ever Random Man cartoon .\n\nThese were made before Erica's transgender
  realization so wrong pronouns were used which was a product of it's time. But there's
  some elements that indicated the fact that Erica is a lesbian born in the wrong
  body which she would come to realize in 2013. \n\nFor more hilarious puppet and
  cartoon animation parodies , Dark Comedy humor , satires and stupid videos\nvisit
