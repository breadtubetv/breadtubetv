title: INFP Sense of Humor  with Numerology 5  at least for me
description: "One of my top videos currently is about the personality types ENFP and
  ENTP sense of humor , today I will be talking about another personality type which
  so happens to be my own “ INFP “ and INFP sense of humor which I feel is basically
  and strongly related due to the Ne cognitive function. Also as an INFP numerology
  5 for the most part , it’s pretty strong Ne sense of humor actually. lol As well
  as a Heyoka empath …. WOW ! lol :P\nThough I feel sometimes the INFP humor can go
  from Ne to Fi Ne from time to time , but perhaps that’s just me as an example. \nFor
  those who are interesting in my INFP sense of humor , perhaps you’d like to check
  out my animated and puppetry comedy and satire videos .\nAlso feel free to check
