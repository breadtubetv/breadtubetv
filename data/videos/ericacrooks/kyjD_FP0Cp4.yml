title: Negativity - What is it and what is it not
description: "Negativity - What is it and what is it not\n\nThere's lots of teachers
  teaching The Law of Attraction , New Thought / New Age Spirituality . Some are good
  and some just do it for capitalism. \n\nI believe what \" Negativity \" refers to
  is more of the feeling state of \" Bad Feeling Thoughts \" as said in The Secret
  , Abraham Hicks , etc .\nHowever those who practice Law of Attraction should still
  take personal responsibility ( Body , Mind and Soul ) . Because what one person
  sees as being \" Negative Energy \" could actually be positive but they use Spiritual
  Bypassing to escape it. Not only is that's not very mature but it just keeps negative
  karma attached and blocking positive manifestations from actually happening. That's
  like if someone did not do any Karma clearing meditation methods when they are \"
  TRIGGERED \" and they just chill out and blame what's outside of themselves as this
  negative thing that needs to be banned even though that's only their perspective.
  That's dangerous. Because Right Wing New Age people exist !\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Age
  ( look on the section called \" IDEAS \" )\n\nFor example : Donald J Trump . He
  may have a wealthy mindset and manifested capitalism but he doesn't care about how
  capitalism hurts everyone and it's a hierarchical system made of hate and fear not
  prosperity like Anarchism . \n\nSomeone could manifest getting away with crime and
  feel positive about anti-social behavior that hurts innocent people without caring.
  That doesn't make it positive at all.\n\nAnd being ignorant and apolitical is nothing
  more but spiritual bypassing . \n\nSure we all need to chill and enjoy the pleasures
  of life no matter where we are if it's a good time with friends , or self , or your
  loved ones.\n\nBut ignoring what's outside of you isn't positive thinking , that's
  avoiding problems which need love to heal itself. Not loving hierarchical systems
  made by sociopaths but intuitively thinking without any limitations of our imagination
  on how \" A New World Can Be Possible \".\n\nAs for The Law of Attraction , I highly
  recommend this link as a research resource for more information.\n\nhttps://in5d.com/12-signs-that-youre-mastering-the-law-of-attraction/\n\n\nAnd
  for Libertarian Socialist Rants video on \" Triggered \"\ncheck it out right here.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mUEtGb8QFo\nIt's
  a great channel , I highly recommend it , check it out.\n( Warning : He has debunked
  \" New Age Spirituality \" but everything else I do agree with )\n\nFor more , feel
