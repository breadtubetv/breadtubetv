title: Western Rape Cultures
description: |-
  I spent too long working on this and missed the moment when people cared about Brock Turner. Everyone has moved on to a mass murder, and the rapist is forgotten, along with that gorilla, and that lion, and that oil spill. Whatever happened with that oil spill? They were going to plug it with trash. Is the gulf okay now, or?

  Anyway, hopefully some of you still care about Brock and rape culture. If you've forgotten you can always Google it.

  I had planned to play the guitar in this video but sliced off a good chunk of my left index finger with a vegetable peeler before recording it. I decided to push ahead anyway. Finger problems never stopped Django Reinhardt or Tommy Iommi. So I recorded this shitty version with a shot glass in lieu of a slide.

  The arguments I oppose in this video are pretty common, but you can find YouTube versions of them, especially in the videos of Thunderf00t and Sargon of Akkad. For instance:
