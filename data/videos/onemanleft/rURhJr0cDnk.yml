title: Douse This Place In Gasoline
description: |-
  Times coming for that ax to fall, somebody's gonna have to pay the piper when he calls. the worlds burning baby, lets have a ball. We'll go dancing on the ashes..and then, build a better world on top of the smoldering coals..

  the only answer is to dismantle the whole goddamn thing
  build it up from the bottom and start over clean..
  foster a culture of inclusive equality to right the wrongs of this society ..but, until then let's douse this place in gasoline!

  Times coming for some heads to roll.. the rich and powerful will pay for what they've done to us all.. dust off your guillotine and let's have ball.. we're gonna dance while the guillotine sings and build a better world on top of their severed skulls!

  the only answer is to dismantle the whole goddamn thing!
  build it up from the bottom and start over clean..
  foster a culture of inclusive equality, to right the wrongs of this society, and forge a future that resembles our wildest dreams..

  until then let's douse this place in gasoline!
