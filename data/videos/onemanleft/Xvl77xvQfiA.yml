title: Left To Defend
description: "A song about hope for the future and worry that we're running out of
  time. \n\nSomeday we won't have to commodify our lives just to survive. \nSomeday..
  oh, someday\nSomeday men won't have to die for the bottom line of wealthy men, and
  the governments that they hide behind.\n\nFrankly I'm sick of waiting for it, lets
  cut to the chase, strike at the root of it.. frankly I'm sick, Frankly I'm sick!\nwe're
  running out of time, society's in decline, the vacuous cultural hegemony of capital
  is making me sick.. it's making me sick!\n\nI don't want to sound like an accelerationist
  but the clocks ticking faster than it's ever been. We've got to act now, we've got
  to make it count or there'll be nothing left to defend. \n\nSomeday all these fascist
  pigs will lie motionless I hope I witness it.. Someday.. oh, someday.\nSomeday their
  mass graves will be just another place to piss, I hope I witness it..\nSomeday..\n\nFrankly
  I'm sick of waiting for it, lets cut to the chase, strike at the root of it.. frankly
  I'm sick, Frankly I'm sick!\nwe're running out of time, society's in decline, the
  vacuous cultural hegemony of capital is making me sick.. it's making me sick!\n\nI
  don't want to sound like an accelerationist but the clocks ticking faster than it's
  ever been. We've got to act now, we've got to make it count or there'll be nothing
  left to defend."
