title: Fuck The World
description: "When my faith in humanity disintegrates its replaced by a nihilistic
  apathy and I'll throw my middle finger in your face.. Fuck the world is what I'll
  say.. Fuck the world is what I'll say.. Because, it's so much easier just to write
  it off. It would take a life time just to calculate all the things I've lost. Maybe
  I'm just bad at math but any way I add it up I always seem to come in last.. so
  this world can just kiss my fucking ass.. \nWhen my faith in the human race evaporates
  a deep seated hatred takes its place, I'm searching for the exit signs.. and I'm
  planning my escape. Fuck the world is what I'll say.."
