title: Who Are Black Leftists Supposed to Be?
description: "\"Who Are Black Leftists Supposed to Be?\" is a satirical take on the
  alienation sometimes felt by black leftists within predominantly white middle class
  leftists spaces. This video is an analysis of class and race and how those intersections
  often go ignored within certain areas of the left. Big thanks to Peter Coffin and
  Eastern Marsh Lands for helping me with this video! \n\n\nMusic: \n\"Graduation
