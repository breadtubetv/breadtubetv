  There are loads of teenagers on YouTube, so in this episode of Behind the Scenes with Olly I was inspired by Maddie Moate to spread a format that could help them out a bit. It got a bit emotional towards the end! If you're a content creator then make your own! Here are the contents so you can jump to what you're looking for:

  Acne: 1:03
  Siblings: 2:00
  Careers and University: 3:24
  Being Healthy: 4:15
  Relationships: 4:58
  Failure: 5:41
  High School: 6:26
  Really Awful Stuff: 7:20
