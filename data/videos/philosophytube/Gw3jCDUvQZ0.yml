title: 'March Book Recommendations: Inspiring Female Authors'
description: |-
  To celebrate International Women's Day, here's 3 books either by or about inspiring women! Some stuff on s*x work with Melissa Grant's "Playing the Whore," some sociology with Ashton Applewhite's "This Chair Rocks," and some witchcraft history with Silvia Federici's "Caliban and the Witch."

  Wish Hannah Witton a speedy recovery: https://www.youtube.com/user/hannahgirasol
