title: Why is Homophobia Irrational? - Philosophy Tube
description: |-
  Are there any good arguments against homosexuality?
  Ethics Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvoAL-KSZ32ecfEjoNjMJyKTFUS5-hNr9

  ADDENDUM: As Matthew Simmermon-Gomes has pointed out below, 'natura nos docet' actually has a much more religious meaning that what I defined it as here. It would actually fall under the religious arguments section, and the argument from being unnatural can stand without it. This was my fault, I apologise for my gross abuse of the Latin.

  Study suggesting intrauterine hormone exposure can determine sexuality: http://www.karger.com/Article/Abstract/262525
  Study suggesting that the number of older brothers a man has affect his chances of being homosexual because of H-Y antigens in the intrauterine environment: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002251939690315X

  If you type 'homosexuality chosen or not' into Google you'll get lots more results. I didn't include more because I'm not sure how many studies people will have access to; I get to see them through my university but your circumstances might be different.

  If anybody is interested in how genetic determination works and the extent to which genes/environment affect you I can recommend the book 'Genome' by Matt Ridley. A little dated in placed but still very easy reading and fascinating stuff.
  If anybody has any more studies or data to share, do!

  Comment music this week is The Pixies' "Where is My Mind?"
