  The books I used (this isn't necessarily what I think of them):
  The Ancient - Plato's Republic
  The Incomprehensible - Kant's Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals
  The Modern - David Lewis' On the Plurality of Worlds
  The Depressive - Albert Camus' The Myth of Sisyphus
  The Activist - Thomas Pogge's World Poverty and Human Rights
  You - An essay I was writing on the definition of creativity
