  WHY ARE COMMENTS UNAVAILABLE??!
  Because Rilke. Basically, I think YouTube comments are great for getting people's first impressions of a topic, but if someone is commenting on a YouTube video it's unlikely they've gone away, thought, and come back. (I have found that the same is often true of reply videos as well, in my experience.) In this case, I want people to go away and live the questions a bit rather than be tempted to fire off a first impression and not think about it anymore.

  In the nightmare of the dark
  All the dogs of Europe bark,
  And the living nations wait,
  Each sequestered in its hate;

  Intellectual disgrace
  Stares from every human face,
  And the seas of pity lie
  Locked and frozen in each eye.

  Follow, poet, follow right
  To the bottom of the night,
  With your unconstraining voice
  Still persuade us to rejoice;

  With the farming of a verse
  Make a vineyard of the curse,
  Sing of human unsuccess
  In a rapture of distress;

  In the deserts of the heart
  Let the healing fountain start,
  In the prison of his days
  Teach the free man how to praise. - Auden
