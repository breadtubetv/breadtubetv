  & English Lyrics)

  About this song:

  For 45 years, the Security Police has tracked and wiretapped communists and revolutionary socialists of various tendencies in Sweden, and put them on their infamous "black lists" consisting of names of people they consider "dangerous to the state." In the 70s, the group Knutna Nävar, which consisted of members of KPML(r), the Communist Party Marxist-Leninist Revolutionaries, wrote this song with the message that it's an honour to be put on this list, because the bourgeois state admits that communists are a threat to them.
