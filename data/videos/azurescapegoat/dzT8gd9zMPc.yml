title: 'Abelina Sabrina Teaches us About America | Shit Island #12'
description: |-
  (NOTE: Because of After Effects nonsense about 30 minutes of this episode were cut out, but it's still available in full on our audio platforms like Spotify, Stitcher, and as an MP3 file on FeedBurner.)

  As Europeans, we lack the cultural context to understand certain things about America. Here to help us with that is the comedian, actress and activist Abelina Sabrina. Sabrina answers some of our questions, like how does voter registration work? Can anyone vote in primaries? How does the healthcare system work? Do most Americans know Puerto Rico is a part of the US? And more!
