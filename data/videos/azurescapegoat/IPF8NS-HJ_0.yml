  Playing LEGO Star Wars and talking to friends.

  100% of the money I get from superchats and adsense on livestreams (and VODs) is donated to various charities. This particular stream's income will be donated to Mermaids UK. Read more about them here: https://www.mermaidsuk.org.uk/about-mermaids.html
