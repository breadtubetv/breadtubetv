description: |-
  Lazze Ohlyz was a Swedish dansband duo active between 2005 and 2010. The group described themselves as northern Europe's first Marxist-Leninist dansband duo and the music is characterized by Lazze Ohlyz border crossing ambitions to mix propagandistic left ideology with country influenced dance music. The genre went according to their own statement under the name Prugg, which is an abbreviation of the concept progressive bugg. Swedish Bugg belongs to the swing dance family and closely resembles Modern Jive, and it's also a variant of the early Lindy Hop (Jitterbug), which came to Sweden in the mid-1940s.
