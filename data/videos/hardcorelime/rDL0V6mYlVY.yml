  Essay by Michael Roder.\n\n\nAUSTRALIAN POLITICAL LEXICON:\n\nPM: Prime Minister.
  Head of Australia’s government.\n\nMP: Member of Parliament\n\nLabor: The major
  ‘centre-left’ party of our two-party system. In power in Australia from 2007-2013.\n\nLiberal:
  The major ‘centre-right’ party of our two-party system. In power in Australia from
  2013-present.\n\nThe Coalition: The partnership between the Liberal party and the
  smaller National party. Term is often used interchangeably with ‘Liberal.’\n\nThe
  Opposition: Whichever party is not in government.\n\nGovernor-General: The Queen’s
  representative in Australia. The official head of government, signs bills into law.
  Power is mostly symbolic.\n\nThe Dismissal: Colloquial name for the 1975 constitutional
  crisis, where the Governor-General dismissed the sitting Prime Minister and dissolved
  Parliament. Seen as a wide overreach of his powers. \n\nStolen Generation: Term
  used to refer to indigenous Australian children who were taken from their parents
  by the Australian government to be raised by white Australians, often in Christian
  missions. Took place between 1905 and the mid 1970s.  \n\nMining Boom: Colloquial
  term for the largest resources rush in Australian history since the gold rush in
  the 1800s. Took place in the mid-2000s. Soaring prices of coal and iron ore in particular
  helped push demand for mining in Australia.\n\nHome Insulation Scheme: Part of Rudd’s
  stimulus package The government offered sizable rebates for homeowners to install
  better insulation in their homes. Many young workers were hired to help with installation,
  without getting proper safety training. Four of these workers died on jobs in four
  months.\n\nDouble Dissolution: a mechanism in the Australian constitution which
  allows the Prime Minister to dissolve parliament after the senate rejects a bill
  twice in the same form. After the election, the rejected bill is introduced in a
  special joint-sitting of parliament, where each member from both houses votes.\n\nGST:
  The ‘Goods and Services Tax.’ A value added 10% tax on most goods and services purchased
  in Australia. Passed by the Howard Government in 2000.\n\nPeter Dutton and Scott
  Morrison as human rights abusers: Both Dutton and Morrison have served as foreign
  ministers for Coalition governments. Australia’s treatment of refugees (Under both
  Liberal AND Labor governments) has come under intense scrutiny from the UN Human
  Rights Council.\n\nFor more info: [https://theconversation.com/un-slams-australias-human-rights-record-87169]
