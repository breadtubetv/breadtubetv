title: Just imagine.....
description: "Taken from a copy pasta on /co/. \n\nImagine being Jack in that scene
  and having to be all like \"damn, Ashi, you fuckin' fine, all sexy with your tight
  body and horrific androgynous monkey face. I would totally have sex with you, both
  my suicidal ghost self and the real me.\" when all he really wants to do is get
  back to the past. Like seriously imagine having to be Jack and not only stand in
  that cemetery while Ashi flaunts her disgusting body in front of you, the favorable
  lighting barely concealing her battle scars and burnt skin, and just stand there,
  while she gave you that stupid look. Not only having to tolerate her monstrous fucking
  visage but her haughty attitude as the entire fanbase tells her she's EXTRA THICC
  and DAMN, ASHI LOOKS LIKE *THAT*?? because they're not the ones who have to stand
  there and watch her mannish fucking gremlin face contort into types of grimaces
  you didn't even know existed before that day. You've been fucking nothing but a
  healthy diet of Southern bounty hunters and evil nature spirits and later alleged
  shapeshifting masters of darkness for your ENTIRE LIFE coming straight out of the
  boonies of the Pit of Hate. You've never even seen anything this fucking disgusting
  before, and now you swear you can taste the sweat that's breaking out on her dimpled
  stomach as she sucks it in to writhe it suggestively at you, smugly assured that
  you are enjoying the opportunity to be thankful to stand there and revel in her
  \"statuesque (for that is what she calls herself)\" beauty, the beauty she worked
  so hard for with her abusive mother all her life. And then the Genndy calls for
  4 more episodes with this bitch, and you know you could kill every single person
  in the production studio before the security could put you down, but you sit there
  and endure, because you're fucking Samurai Jack. You're not going to lose your chance
  to find your sword over this. Just bear it. Hide your face and bear it."
