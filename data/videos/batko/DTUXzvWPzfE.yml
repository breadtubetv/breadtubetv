title: /leftypol/ choir- I'll be flagging you
description: "LYRICS\n\nEvery vid you make,\nEvery joke you take,\nEvery piece you
  create,\nEvery meme you make,\n\nI'll be flagging you\nYou're all that I hate,\nYour
  memes get me quite irrate,\nThough I shout free speech,\nI'll censor what you preach,\nI'll
  be flagging you\n\nOh can't you see, \nYour memes offend me,\nWon't block you or
  look away,\nI'll just flag what you say. \n\nTake you down, and again,\nyou get
  back up,\nthat will not stop me,\ntake you down for hate speech\nagainst the an-caps
  and bourgoisie\nIs it autism, we'll just wait and see"
