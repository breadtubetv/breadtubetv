description: "ORIGINAL LYRICS AND INSPIRATION FOR THIS VID COME FROM HERE\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYTxcXmvBDA&t=70s\n\n\nLYRICS\n\nIt
  all began when reddit heard the news\nIt was clear that they had become envious\nThe
  mods wanted us to hurt!\nAnd sperged out all over their threads!\n\nThey began purging
  comrades left and right!\nAnd called upon our enemies to help\nWe had only one option
  left!\nFight back against the controlled opposition!\n\nDefend the catgirls!\nFight
  for our culture!\nDon't let the cointelpro win!\nFight for Rodina!\nTroll for Alunya!And
  don't forget LEFTCOM CAT!\n\nDon't fear their stupid rules, that all chain us!\nKeep
  up the shitposts, until they crack!\nFight Divisive idpol!\nDown with the liberals!\n\nDestroy
  the controlled opposition!\nSo Fight for Rodina!\nTroll for Alunya!\nAnd don't forget
  about leftcom cat! \n\nWe've achieved a small victory!\nNevermind those lying trots\nThey
  call for reform but without our input!\nAnd shift the blame on us instead of them!\nThey
  claim to have removed the fuckwit mods!\nWe guess they're on new accounts!\nDon't
  take their bullshit anymore!\nOverthrow the controlled opposition!\n\n(CHORUS)"
