  LYRICS

  (Chorus): Well, I punched Richard Spencer
  It felt like cottage cheese
  His face smeared all over my hand
  As he fell to his knees.
  I had a mask on at the time so
  Nobody'd recognize me.
  And nobody can prove it now,
  Not even the police.
  (verse/same riff):
  Well, it was inauguration day,
  Everyone was ill
  And all their biker fags were out
  To give the liberals chills.
  It could have been just any day
  'Til black bloc hit the hill.
  And I punched out that fascist fuck
  And haunt his nightmares still.
  (repeat chorus)
