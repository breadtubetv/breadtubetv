title: /leftypol/ choir- Every Porky wants to rule the world (anti-imperialist anthem)
description: "Thanks to the anon who lent me his wonderful set of pipes\n\nLyrics\n\nTime
  to start a coup\nOr go and rig some votes\nDo deals with the war-lords, \n\nAll
  to seize the mass resources, \ngain forced labour,\nmasquerade as some new saviour\n\nEveryporky
  wants to rule the world \n\nIt's our own design,\nfor wars to run their course,\nIf
  our interests align, \n\nthen we'll back you,with some weapons,\nand with profit,\ntaken
  from the people's pocket,\n\nEveryporky wants to rule the world,\n\nIf a nation
  becomes defiant,\nor starts to become self-reliant, \nwhen they do we'll back right
  wing tyrants, \n\nSo glad we claimed some new soil,\npeople died, sure but hey!
  More oil, \nEveryporky wants to rule the world\n\nAll for democracy, and freedom,
  \nWorkers rights, get fucked who needs them?\nEveryporky wants to rule the world\n\nSay,
  that we'd never ever never ever want war,\nbut we might start one, if we need more,\nEveryporky
  wants to rule the world\n\nBomb a city, starve a country,\nthey'll work hard, \nif
  we make them hungry\nEveryporky wants to rule the world"
