description: "Special thanks to the Anons who lent their voices.\n\nLYRICS\n\nBat'ko:
  This workplace is ours, \nthe choice of working hours, \nthis property, \nfrom the
  bourgeoisie, \nIt's ours ours ours ours, \n\nAnon2: This commune is ours\nThis barbers
  saloon is ours\nThe city streets\nBeneath Both of your feet\nThey're all emphatically
  ours\n\nAnon 3: It all belongs to us\nThat restraunt to that bus\nNorth, south,
  east and west\n\nALL: We caress it, 'cause we possess it\nWe've seized it and it
  ours\n\nThe floor and ceiling are ours\nAll your property's ours\nYou always knew
  it\nThat's all there is to it\nIt's ours, ours, ours, ours, ours,"
