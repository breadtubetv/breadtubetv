title: /leftypol/ choir- anti-anglo gang (RE-UPLOAD)
description: "Disclaimer: I do not view Anglos as a people as lesser nor do I hate
  them. This is a shitpost first and foremost. I condemn any unironic racism to anyone
  of british heritage. I only say this due to the last time this was uploaded it was
  taken down for hate speech. \n\nAlso, this is officially, the last song of the /leftypol/
  choir, before it adopts the name \"The Black Army Choir\". May as well go out with
  a fan-favourite."
