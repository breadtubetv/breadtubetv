  1917, \nRevolutions in the air \nThe Palace has been breached,\nand they're crying
  in despair, \n\nThe whites are on their way, \nThe decision must be made, \nand
  the Royals are gonna to pay, \nfor the lives that we have laid, \n\nDying in their
  name, \nbut today we say no more, \nBecause Nicholas is a cuck, \nand his wife is
  a whore, \n\nThe vanguard is in place, \nthe streets are slick with gore, \nof the
  upper class elites,\nit's time for them to hit the floor \n\n\nC H O R U S\nAnd
  now I just shot the tsar,\nand it feels so good, \nto be rid of monarchy, \n\nYeah
  I'm hard from shooting the tsar, \nstiff as oak wood, \nas I know that I should
  be\n\nYeah maybe killing kids is bad, \nbut killing the tsar, \ncan't say that I
  am sad, \n\nYeah there's blood from shooting the tsar, \nthe smell of smoke,\nand
  boy do I feel glad \n\nYeah that's right, I just shot the tsar, \nCivil war will
  start, \nbut I ain't even mad\n\nHoly shit I just shot the tsar, \ngotta tell you
  I thought \nI'd never come this far\n\nLet the revolution commence, \nfrom shooting
  the tsar, \nSend the cheka out in force, \n\nGotta tell ya just shot the tsar, \nprepare
  yourselves,\nfor the war to run its course"
