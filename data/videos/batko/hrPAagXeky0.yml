  (Instrumental backing track)\n\nLYRICS\n\nDuring posts we are all quite wary, \nof
  the talks of Red Hungary, \n'Cause to tell you quite frankly, \nIt once triggered
  a tankie\n\nAnd he said go! Go! Go! \nAnd he did cry in great song!\nThat Stalin
  did nothing wrong!\nThe splitters deserved it! \nYou're full of shit! Let's go!\n\nThen
  another tankie chimed in, \nhe said Holodomor did not happen!\nThey are lies told
  against Uncle Joe!\nKulaks deserved it don't you know! \n\nAnd he said go! Go! Go!\nPraise
  to the old Man of Steel! \nHolodomor is not real! \nThat shit did not happen!\nPraise
  Stalin! Let's go!\n\nSo to say, the thread derailed, \nhow the tankies cried and
  wailed! \nThreads of hungary are now quite rare, \nBecause of all the tankies there,
  \n\nAll shouting Go! Go! Go! \nGulags for all humanists!\nThey are just revisionists!
  \nYou're all just anarchists!\nOh I'm pissed! Let's go! \n\nAuthoritarian dictators,
  \nHoxha fans, and Kim Jong praisers\nThey'll deny, \nwhine, bitch and cry, \nand
  tell you all to go and die, \n\nWhile they shout, \nGo! Go! Go! \nI get my news
  from unruhe! \nI will be coming for you! \nYou damn imperialist!\nEat my fist! Let's
  go"
