title: /leftypol/ choir- Albanian Nights
description: "A cover of a /leftypol/ classic\n\nLYRICS\n\nOh I come from a land,
  \nIt's a Stalinist place, \nwhere nobodies allowed to roam. \n\nIt's a capital offence,\n
  and the laws are intense, \nautocratic, but hey, it's home\n\nWith our foes to the
  east, \nand the sea to the west, \nand the bunkers are built just right, \n\nCome
  on down, \ngot shot by, \nSigurimi and die, \nJust another Albanian nights, \n\nAlbanian
  Nights,\nLike Albanian Days, \nMore often than not, \nAre massive hotspots, \nfor
  unmarked mass graves,\n\nAlbanian knights, \nlike Albanian Moons, \nA fool off his
  guard, \ncan be beaten hard, \nby Hoxhas mad goons"
