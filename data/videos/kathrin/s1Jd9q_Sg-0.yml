title: 'Leaving Neverland: Paedophilic Culture, Heteronormativity and Silencing of
  Victims'
description: |
  In this video I discuss the importance of Leaving Neverland from my perspective as
  a child sexual abuse survivor. I attempt to bring the conversation surrounding this
  documentary back to challenging our inadequate judicial system, paedophilic culture,
  child sexual abuse generalisations, the silencing of victims, heteronormativity
  and patriarchy.
