title: 'Voluntourism: doing more harm than good?'
description: |
  I discuss the neocolonial and neoliberal elements of voluntourism. How it promotes
  the white saviour complex, poverty aesthetics, cultural cannibalism, promotes the
  demonstration effect, cultural insensitivity, white man’s burden and uneven development.
  It can also enhance a lack of long term planning and can increase unemployment and
  dependency on the west.
