title: '"Cancelling", Building walls and Gate Keeping (Peter Coffin, Angie Speaks
  Drama)'
description: |-
  Excommunication (Canceling) by fellow leftists for associating with the wrong people is something I find reprehensible.

  It is a long standing policy of this channel to not discuss drama... So I will do it indirectly.
  Since subtlety is confusing, this drama involves Peter Coffin, Angie Speaks and several other leftist youtubers being "canceled" for indirectly associating with the wrong people. I usually wouldn't make a statement, but this is bullshit.
