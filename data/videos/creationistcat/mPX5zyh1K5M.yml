  banned from Vadim:\n \n\nHey guys, before we begin the festivities I, CC’s humble
  human slave would just like to say a few words about Alex Jones and his channel
  being removed. Uhhh, it’s no secret I loathe the horrible disinformation this man
  has unleashed on the world, his lies, his slandering of good people. The violence
  his paranoia has perpetuated. I think he’s basically a human bucket of donkey shit,
  apologies if that’s insulting to donkey shit. In fact, I’m not a violent guy, but
  I’ve long said that if there was some sort of situation where I absolutely had to
  punch one person in all of politics and pop culture— if it was like a ‘punch someone
  or I’ll shoot this adorable puppy, kitten a baby seal and your first born child
  right in front of you” type situation, it would definitely be Alex Jones. In a heartbeat.
  Wouldn’t have to think twice about it.\n\nThat being said, even though there may
  be sufficient reasons for his removal, I’m sure he may have genuinely broken terms
  of service due to a number of things he’s said, done, instigated and lied about,
  I have to say this STILL does not sit well with me. It’s a scary precedent that
  I believe is being set. I think that if he can go after all this time many channels
  on the left and the right can go as well. This channel currently has a strike for
  a video we made over five years ago that advertised a Doctor’s without Border’s
  charity campaign and we merely said the word Boner several times and showed a picture
  of soccer players with super tight shorts for like five seconds, so as a content
  creator I worry about what this could mean for dozens of channels I love as well
  as my own. It’s possible I feel this way purely due to undue paranoia that I feel
  as a creator and for my youtube creator friends. I realize that and all that being
  said, maybe I’ll change my mind on this one so don’t freak out if you feel otherwise.
  Let’s agree to disagree and let’s have some fun taking a stroll down memory lane
  and watching all the InfoWars related content we’ve had on the channel over the
  years… There’s a guide in the Christ-box in case you’ve already watched one and
  want to skip ahead. Enjoy and later shodomites!!!"
