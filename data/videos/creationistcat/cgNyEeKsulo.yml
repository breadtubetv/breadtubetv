  Christmas Holiday Star Wars extravaganza unlike any freaking other! CC watches the
  rarely seen and much hated 1978 Star Wars Holiday Special. Is it really as freaking
  horrible as people say it is? Should George Lucas be ritually sodomized and thrown
  into a volcano for allowing it to exist? Who da freak is Lumpy and why does CC want
  to stretch his furry cadaver on to his living room floor like a bear-skin rug? These
  questions and more will be answered!!!!\n\nWritten, directed and produced by Vadim
