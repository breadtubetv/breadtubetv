  Hey sodomites! Welcome to da very first episode of "At Da Freaking Movies!"

  Today I'm reviewing an awesome freaking movie dats going to hit theaters on September 26th titled "A Matter of Freaking Faith". I really tink diss is going to signal da tipping point in America where we realize dat Biblical Creation can no longer be ignored as a viable scientific alternative to evolution. In fact, I'm hoping dat it causes rioting in da freaking streets and dee eventual removal of evolution from are classrooms al-to-freaking-tether.
