description: "Well, in case you haven't heard UK comedian Count Dankula (aka Mark
  Meechan) was freaking sentenced for 'grossly offensive' acts after training his
  Pug to sieg freaking heil like a nazi and #FreeDankula is in full swing. Although
  CC believes Dankula should go free what should be done with his evil Nazi Pug 'Buddha'?
