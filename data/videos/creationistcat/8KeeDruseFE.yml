  you deep into the bowels of Parisian Hell in a behind the scenes look at Lauren
  Southern's \"Streets of Paris\" video. But be warned! Creationist Cat and Lauren
  may have uncovered the very destruction of everything the French hold dear. Yes
  my shodomites, the French Apocalypse is upon us! And only Lauren Southern and Creationist
  Cat can save us from the Islamification/Refugee Crisis/all out assault on baguettes
  that shall ensue. Watch it this video or France will totally burn in Hell!\n\n✔Support
