  the sound out of the merry go round\nwhen the outlaws deciphered the code\nbut theres
  a price on their heads\nthey were poisoned in bed\nbefore they ever reached their
  buried gold\nand its too early to tell if this is heaven or hell\nso let it go let
  it go let it go\nas we move from the crowd to the outskirts of town\nwe were running
  up the foot of the hill\nand across from the trash the scattered millions burn fast\nand
  the flames have grown greedier still\nyes and i amazed how very little has changed\nfrom
  day to day to day to day\n(today today taking it day to day to day)\n\nTwitter :
