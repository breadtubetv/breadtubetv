  Special Thanks to King Hellbent!**** Sub to Hellbent here:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/HellbentTMA\n\nThe
  following edited video was uploaded in the summer of 2016, but was subsequently
  removed for \"bullying\". This was ridiculous because CC is a satirical comedy channel
  and the person discussed in the sequence that was mistaken for bullying is in fact
  a friend of the Creationist Cat Channel. This video CONTAINS A DISCLAIMER BY THAT
  PERSON (GMAN) SAYING THAT HE FULLY UNDERSTANDS THIS WAS A JOKE. This video was wrongly
  flagged and furthermore, aside from this being a joke, ***this channel was also
  subject to a flagging campaign the day this video was flagged.*** That's a claim
  we can easily prove. We spoke with those who work through youtube and they told
  us that the introductory disclaimer would be enough to make sure this video is not
  flagged again, but please pay attention to this further explanation in the crazy
  event that this is flagged down successfully a second time... The CC channel does
  not, has not and will never partake in or condone bullying of any kind. Please understand
  that ANYTHING that could even vaguely be construed as such is done purely for comedy
  purposes and is, in fact, PRETEND. Thank you.\n\nStalk me on Facebook and Twitter:\n\nTwitter
