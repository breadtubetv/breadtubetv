  Creationist Cat\n\n*** Da issue of TYT already being a \"partner\" with Al Jazeera
  has been brought up by many. I knew this before making da video (I refer to this
  partnership in THIS video at 8:50!) it's where I first got da information about
  Roo's stance on this in da first place and I do make mention of this video on my
  appearance on the Drunken Peasants da day I premiered dish one. A \"partnership\"
  with Al Jazeera is not sufficient evidence of TYT being paid to completely distort
  the news and create a pro-Islamic narrative. Just because they happen to have this
  partnership does not mean that they were distorting the news at AL Jazeera's say
  so at all. This is a VERY damning claim and far more evidence is required to substantiate
  it than just a casual partnership between the two (which has not even produced that
  much content.) \n\nIn the description of one video titled \"Al Jazeera Refuses To
  Use The Word “Terrorist”  Roo describes TYT as having an \"allegiance\" to Al Jazeera,
  then goes on to say \"The Muslim apologetics and propaganda machine is in full swing.\"
  Clearly Roo is claiming that TYT is deliberately shifting the news to create a VERY
  pro Islamic narrative. He is claiming TYT is not presenting a version of the news
  they find authentic and has essentially been bought out. Again, a casual partnership
  with another network is not sufficient evidence they are participating in this extremely
  dishonest act. \n\nI include a link within this video where Cenk outlines why he
  left MSNBC. It was a mutual decision made due to the fact Cenk could not hold his
  tongue when it came to many issues that MSNBC did not want him to speak out against.
  His ratings were more than decent and if he chose to conform he could have had an
  extremely lucrative job and the possibility of TYT being absorbed into the MSNBC
  also seemed like a likely possibility. I believe the fact that he did not enter
  into this partnership speaks volumes about the Al Jazeera situation.\n\nThere is
  certainly more that can be said about this, but I'm not going to write a dissertation.
  It breaks down to what I've already said, a casual business partnership is not sufficient
  evidence of TYT doing something that dishonest and unethical.\n\n****This is not
  a defense of TYT. This is a very basic debunking of a conspiracy theory that Roo
  has brought forward. I would do the same thing for Fox News or any other news source
  if I felt the evidence being brought to the table was as poor as Roo's.****\n\nI
  have NO PROBLEM with criticizing TYT for a myriad of other reasons. There's certainly
  a lot to choose from, but in this case I defend TYT in da shame way one might defend
  GWB from allegations of him masterminding 9/11 by \"truthers\". \n\n***** New Addendum
  written on October 18th*****   In AIU's new vid (which, nope I haven't watched and
  I won't) he shows lots of clips from AJ+ and TYT collabs. In this playlist featured
  on the TYT channel there are just 25 videos after a seven month partnership: \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJRjPUKULQ8&list=PLTpcK80irdQiwRoXhszOgDzI7CmWwTO4n\n\nAIU
  mocks me for supposedly being ignorant of a wealth of videos their partnership has
  produced. But you must take into account that TYT typically produces more than this
  much material in five days. Many of these videos are under five minutes. And PLEASE
  keep in mind that about a quarter of these or more were produced AFTER I posted
  my video. But even if all of them were produced at the time I posted my video, is
  that really much material at all? I definitely don't think so. \n\n****Update August
  28 2016****\n\nChecked that playlist again, no more videos have been added to it
  in nearly a year.  :P"
