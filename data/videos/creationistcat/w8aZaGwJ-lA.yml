description: "A very important video I had to make on da fly... \n\n✔Support me on
  Patreon: http://bit.ly/1ASeYOt\n✔One-time contribution with PayPal: http://bit.ly/1eQR4sR\n✔Buy
  the T-Shirt: http://CreationistCatTees.com\n\nANY purchase of the multitude of Tees
  offered at CreationistCatTees.com helps CC Ministries quite a freakin' bit!\n\nTo
  make everything absolutely clear I totally condemn this. It was a clear false flag,
  AIU does not deserve a strike like this, he didn't do anything that violated YT's
  terms of service and although I understand his video was a cavalcade of bullcrap,
  he's got a right to free speech like da rest of us.\n\n\nSuper Duper Awesome \"Burn
  In Hell\" Animation by Eduard Riegel\n\nStalk me on Twitter and Facebook why don't
  cha?\n\nTwitter : @CreationistCat\n\nFacebook : CreationistCat"
