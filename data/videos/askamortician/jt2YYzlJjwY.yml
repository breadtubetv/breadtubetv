  \ \n\nForeskin Fun Fact! Austrian nun Agnes Blannbekin \"led a life devoted to the
  foreskin of Jesus\". The study says: \"She was obsessed by the loss of blood and
  the pain which the redeemer had suffered during his circumcision. On one occasion,
  when she was moved to tears by the thought of this suffering, she suddenly felt
  the foreskin on her tongue.\" http://www.theguardian.com/education/2009/feb/17/circumcision-jesus-christ"
