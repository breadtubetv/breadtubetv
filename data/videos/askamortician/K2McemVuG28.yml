  long quotes pulled for video: \n\nA Providential Escape – A few days ago one young
  family of the Hon. A. Ellis, residing at Bognor, were, together with the governess
  and two maids, nearly poisoned, owing to their having eaten some blancmange, a part
  of which was coloured a bright light green; very fortunately this green part had
  an unpleasant taste, which prevented their eating more of it. The medical man who
  analyzed the remaining quantity found it to contain a verdigris powder. Whilst he
  had it in a liquid state he dipped into it a knife, which became instantly covered
  with this green copperas, and he asserts that there was a sufficient portion of
  this poisonous powder in the quantity analyzed to kill six persons. As it is, the
  two maids and governess and one of the children are still suffering from its dangerous
  effects. It appears this powder for colouring the green part had been purchased
  from a pastrycook in london but it is to be observed that such an article ought
  never to be sold for such purposes, and this has been inserted as a caution to the
  public. (The Blackburn Standard, 18th February, 1846)\n\nPoisoning at a public dinner
  – great excitement has existed at Northampton, in consequence of the sudden illness
  of 20 out of about 60 persons who attended a public dinner at the New Hall, which
  followed the ordination of the Rev. G. Nicholson, B.A., as the minister of the Ring-street
  dissenting chapel, in the room of the Rev. T. Milner. The viands were of the usual
  substantial kind, and before the cloth was removed some of the gentlemen were seized
  with sickness and vomiting, while others were taken ill at a later period of the
  entertainment. One of them, Mr Cornfield, an accountant in the town, expired at
  five o’clock on Thursday morning. The dinner was provided by a Mr Franklin, at whose
  house the whole of the cooking utensils were seized by order of the magistrates.
  At the inquest held on the body of the deceased, the medical witnesses stated that
  they had detected copper in the green coloring stuff which coated the blancmange
  used at the dinner. A verdict of “Manslaughter” was accordingly returned against
  Mr Franklin, by whom the dinner was provided, and against Randall, the cook. (The
  Examiner, 17th June, 1848)"
