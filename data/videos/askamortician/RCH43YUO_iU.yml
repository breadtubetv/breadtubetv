  LATEST NEWS:

      The Virginia House Subcommittee on Health, Welfare and Institutions has been given SB595. Chairperson Richard Bell (R) and all four members of the subcommittee (O’Bannon (R), Orrock (R), Garrett (R) and James (D) have received another letter from the NHFA president. Our VA home funeral advocates are now making calls and writing to them as well. The petition floated by a Virginia citizen that got more than 700 signatures in a week has been sent to the subcommittee as well. The attorney we consulted agreed with all the steps taken. And the media has taken up the story, thanks to several active NHFA members.
