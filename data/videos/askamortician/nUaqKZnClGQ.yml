  shaped.) - term mostly used in N. America. \n\n- A coffin has six sides, with a
  top and bottom, (hexagonal shaped)\nThe word coffin comes from the Old French cofin
  and from the Latin cophinus, which translates into basket. The word was first used
  in the English language in 1380.  A coffin is defined as a box or chest for the
  display/burying of a corpse. When used to transport the deceased, a coffin may also
  be referred to as a pall.\n\n- In 1785 Joseph II introduced a bunch of burial regulations.
  Corpses were to be buried naked and sewn into a simple cloth shroud. The Emperor
  also wasn't keen on wasting wood for coffins to the idea of a the so-called ‘economy
  coffin’, which could be used several times came about. It was made of wood and its
  lower side was fitted with a flap which could be opened to allow the body being
  buried to drop into the grave. However, the Viennese did not care much for this
  form of rationalization and protested. After just six months Joseph II had to withdraw
  the measure. Pic and details of burial reforms here: http://michaelorenz.blogspot.com/2013/07/mozart-and-myth-of-reusable-coffins.html\n\n-
  In the United States, the early casket industry evolved from local furniture and
  cabinet makers who were the logical choice for building caskets. They eventually
  took on other duties like hiring and driving hearses and this evolved into the job
  of undertaker. Caskets on an as-needed basis. During times of plague - diphtheria,
  flu, etc. many rural areas ran out of wood and would disassemble barns, carriages
  or other furniture to provide wood for a loved one's coffin. During the Civil War,
  thousands of coffins were needed to transport dead soldiers, marking the start of
  the mass-produced casket era.\n\n- The Fisk Coffin: \"In 1848, Almond Fisk patented
  a metal coffin he believed would revolutionize death. One problem: some people thought
  the burial case with its human contours was creepy as hell.\" http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/morbid-monday-fisk-mummy-case"
