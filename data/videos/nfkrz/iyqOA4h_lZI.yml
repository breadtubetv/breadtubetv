  (spoiler warning for GTA 4 & Brat movies)
  Grand Theft Auto IV is arguably the greatest GTA game ever, loved by fans for its story. In this video, I provide an in-depth look on how Russian movies, such as "Брат", "Брат 2" and "Behind Enemy Lines" served as inspiration for Rockstar to create the story of Niko Bellic. Hope you enjoy, make sure to SMASH like for more videos like this!
