title: A Response to "Noam Chomsky - Lenin, The USSR, and the Predictions of Bakunin"
description: |-
  Welcome to hopefully what is a one off "response video" but I felt compelled to make a response to it. If you love this video or hate it let me know I might consider trying to find a way to fit in more off the cuff unscripted content like this. This was 3 hours to make unlike the 20-35 hours of effort the others take.
