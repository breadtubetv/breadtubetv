title: An Open Letter to Anarcho Communists
description: "The questions are as followed:\n\nWould I have to feel annoyed with
  the gear that I have bought from companies?\n\nDo all An-coms believe in the LTV?\n\nCan
  I still give to charity?\n\nDo most An-coms support Feminism?\n\nDo An-coms agree
  with taxes?\n\nWould An-coms agree with the idea that even though Capitalism is
  evil, in its freest forms it has elevated the standard of living exponentially in
  comparison to Feudal living which only created enough to survive? \n\nDo An-coms
  support Greenpeace\n\nDo An-coms oppose the idea of Genetically modifying plants?\n\nIf
  I am like Michael Moore and I criticise Capitalism but make lots of money out of
  my enterprise and use that buy lots of lavish stuff, am I a hypocrite?\n\nDo you
  agree with the minimum wage even if it prevents some from getting work.\n\nThoughts
  on Trigger warnings\n\nDo you like Che\n\nDo you like Russell Brand\n\nWould I have
  to disown and despise all my favourite Capitalist minds like Julie Borowski, Larken
  Rose and in a very sympathic way Milton Friedman if I became Communist?\n\nDo I
  have to condone the use of violence in certain scenarios even if its not being initiated
  upon me. As I am against aggressing violence as I find that the easiest and most
  consistent to stand by.\n\nHow would we deal with high skilled, high demand jobs
  such as Surgeons without the incentive of pay in a Communist society.\n\nUnions?\n\nI
  make films, would I be able to hierarchically control the production of that film
  with other people and pay them to help me make it?\n\nNot strictly related but,
  Why are there so few Housing cooperatives?"
