  and a few others, the whole point of BLM is to address a specific response, yet
  so many choose to view this as somehow racism against other races.\nVern's video:

  family:\nhttp://www.cracked.com/blog/6-weird-things-you-learn-when-youre-raised-to-be-racist/\nInteresting
  part of it - \n\"This is the weirdest part of growing up in a racist family, and
  a racist environment as a whole (at least in my own experience): Even though their
  biggest form of racism was against black people, they all had black friends and
  black heroes. My dad's four favorite shows at the time were The Jeffersons, Good
  Times, Sanford And Son, and, strangely, Soul Train. He never missed an episode.
  When I was a kid, our closest family friends were a black family ... who were, ironically,
  named the Jeffersons.\n\nIt was the same with all of my friends. Their favorite
  comedians were Richard Pryor and Eddie Murphy. I know very few of them who didn't
  own and blast an NWA cassette while cruising through town. The point is, they're
  not Confederate-flag-waving, white-power advocates. The racism I saw was often hidden
  behind closed doors or confined to private conversations. In fact, if you were to
  ask any of these people if they considered themselves racists, not one of them would
  say yes. Even though it was commonplace to hear my dad telling stories about beating
  up, specifically, black guys after playing against them in a high school basketball
  game. Or a friend's dad giving his opinion on Mexicans in general by saying, \"Leave
  their corpses by the fence and let Border Patrol sort it out.\" Nope. Absolutely
  nothing racist about that at all.\""
