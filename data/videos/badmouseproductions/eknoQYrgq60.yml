  A short tutorial for people who don't understand the differences between Private Property and Personal Property.
  Edit: In addition to Private Property being used for profit, what is also crucial is that it must be exploiting other people's labour for profit. This marks the difference between someone being a wood turner using their own labour (A personal Lathe), and a factory using 100 lathes to make money for a company using employees.
