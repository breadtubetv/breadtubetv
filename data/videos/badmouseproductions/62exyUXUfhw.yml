  There's a little yellow ball of idiocy surfing around the facebook scene that has been garbling up idiocy 20+ times a day... Looks like he needs a bit of buttkicking.
  Robin Hood stories:
  http://d.lib.rochester.edu/teams/text/robin-hood-and-the-potter-introduction
  http://d.lib.rochester.edu/teams/text/robin-hood-and-the-monk-introduction

  And those are just some of the many tales of Robin Hood, rest can be viewed here.

  Seriously though, the 'Folklore Revisionism' that An-caps do to Robin Hood is so ignoramusly poor in its conception, its like someone just watched a few Robin Hood films, saw the Sheriff of Nottingham's feuds with him and then just decided "Oooh taxes! Therefore Robin Hood was an An-cap style figure. *Drops Mic*"

  Idiots... (Apologies, medieval ages lover here :L)
