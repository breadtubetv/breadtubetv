title: 'From Liberal to Communist: My political ''Journey'''
description: "A summary of my political journey so far in the best way I could explain
  it so far. Its been 6 years in the making, whew.\n\nBlack Red Guard's channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpYZYH_1VTB9q8Leg0TrROA/videos\n\nPatreon:

  people have thought at the end that I'm calling for Left Unity, this isn't the point
  I was trying to get across. The point is to take politics seriously, BRG at the
  end talks about how more privileged people flip between ideologies, Why? Because
  we can. We don't have the monkey breathing down our neck, so we can treat politics
  more like a game where we can sit back and idealise great socialist societies, instead
  of something that will result in a violent bitter revolution in which thousands
  will die, in which an aftermath where people will not get all the boons of socialism
  delivered to them immediately, where people will continue to want to destroy our
  society by any means necessary. \nAs I say I've grown cynical as time's gone on,
  somehow I just can't imagine a revolution happening in Britain or America until
  numerous other countries have achieved it, I just get the feeling that as a society
  as of present, we're just not serious enough about how this is all gonna go down."
