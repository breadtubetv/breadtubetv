description: "Twitter - Badmouse101\nA discussion about the recent Libertarian exodus
  to Alt-right, and a plea to more Voluntarist Libertarians with inspiration from
  David Graeber.\n*A lot of people have stated stuff along the lines of... \"People
  fled East Germany not West Germany, this is a stupid analogy\" This scenario I have
  described is whereby both sides are on an equal playing field from the beginning.
  If you look at history, Socialism has not been on the same playing field as Capitalism,
  Socialism has always arisen from Capitalism (or something to that effect), not from
  some entity completely separate from this system, and thereby it was not on a level
  playing field.\nAs I have stated, Capitalism relies on a steady supply of Workers
  in order for such businesses people to succeed and gain wealth in the first place.
  Thereby the point is, why would you want to work a shitty job when an equally sized
  organised Commune is sitting right on your doorstep.\nThe justification might be
  that - You have the potential to be the one who stomps his foot down on the workers
  - but this is 1. A pretty shitty reason, and 2. Only a small amount would ever reach
  that level. \n\nLacking Saint: \nyoutube.com/user/LackingSaint/videos\n\nMusic used:\nBilly
