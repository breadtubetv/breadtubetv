title: Anarchopac VS Stefan Molyneux
description: "I was 18 and had been studying philosophy at university for a few months.
  Stefan in comparison claimed to be an actual philosopher like Socrates who'd provided
  the first secular proof of ethics in human history. I think I did well relative
  to such a titan. \n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/anarchopac\nhttps://twitter.com/anarchopac"
