description: "I went on revolutionary left radio and had a nice chat about anarchism.
  Topics covered include what anarchist social theory is, what anarchists mean by
  the state, why anarchists reject seizing state power, what organisational dualism
  is and more. \n\nTaken from: https://revolutionaryleftradio.libsyn.com/in-dialogue-with-anarchism-anarchopac\n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/anarchopac\nhttps://twitter.com/anarchopac\n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/RevLeftRadio\nhttps://twitter.com/RevLeftRadio"
