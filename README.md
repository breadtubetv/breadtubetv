# BreadTube.tv

This is the working project for the redesign and relaunch of BreadTube.tv.

This second iteration of the project aims to solve these two key problems of the first site.

- Design: Improve Usability through a purposeful design
- Moderation: Improve Usability through an automated update system

## Design

Daniel Torres has provided the wireframes and logos for the site

## System

We are currently investigating the best systems to operate the site on

- ~~Hugo~~ Current system, too difficult to update
- ~~Strapi~~ investigated, lack of database migrations make development difficult
- http://tv.kommun.ist/
- WordPress Website
- Custom Rails Application
