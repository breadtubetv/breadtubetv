description: 'Here’s a companion guide to Ericco Malatesta’s 1891 pamphlet Anarchy.
  The goal here is to encourage you to read theory! You can read a chapter and then
  watch the video corresponding to that chapter to better understand the content or
  just as a refresher before moving on with book. If you decide to follow the series
  without reading the book, that’s fine, you will still learn about anarchist theory.
