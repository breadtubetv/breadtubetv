description: '[CW: graphic/sexual assault] Rep. Ilhan Omar questioning war criminal
  Elliott Abrams at a hearing is pure justice. Oh, we stan! She makes him reckon with
  the genocide and crimes against humanity he oversaw in Guatemala, El Salvador and
  Nicaragua to his lizard face. Support us on Patreon: http://patreon.com/ArtHousePolitics

  Elliott Abrams is special envoy to Venezuela, instead of special envoy to a jail
  cell. John Bolton admits on Fox that the Venezuelan coup is about oil. #StandWithIlhan
  Ilhan Omar is one of the first Muslim women in Congress along with Rashida Tlaib,
  and she came in swinging against the foreign policy consensus and corrosive corruption
  in DC. The right wing coordinated a media attack calling her antisemitic when she
  criticized AIPAC for influencing Israel policy. Liberals played their part, Pelosi
  and Schumer issued a condemnation and the GOP is now calling for her to resign.'
