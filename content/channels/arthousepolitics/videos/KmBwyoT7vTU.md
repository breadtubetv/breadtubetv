  My Father compilation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHbrNz1RUVY Meghan McCain
  is a conservative republican talk show host on The View with Joy Behar, Whoopie
  Goldberg and Sunny Hostin. When yelling about socialism, Venezuela, border security,
  the Trump administration, or MY FATHER MY FATHER MY FATHER John McCain war hero,
  she might meltdown and clash with her co-hosts. Not technically but basically Jewish
  and is very scared about antisemitism (Ilhan Omar). Clips taken from Only90sKids
  "Meghan McCain saying "My Father..." for 1 minute straight (2008-2019)", The Young
  Turks TYT "Meghan McCain''s Meltdown" and various Meghan McCain worst moments compilations.'
