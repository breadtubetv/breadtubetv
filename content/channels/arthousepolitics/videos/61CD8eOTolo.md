  ... Hillary Clinton, the Election Understander, has logged on to re-litigate the
  2016 Democratic primary against Bernie Sanders, who''s not a real Democrat, in an
  interview. This meme edit was made by Art House Politics, a creator on Left Tube
  - a video & meme space led by Contrapoints, hbomberguy and Shaun. Bernie and his
  socialist minions criticize the party from the left. Attacked, from the left! She
  favors Kamala Harris, who is a cop. Kamala harris is a cop. Those who oppose a centrist
  nominee for the 2020 primary are encouraged to go away. Evacuate the party. This
  is a pragmatic strategy from a campaign genius.'
