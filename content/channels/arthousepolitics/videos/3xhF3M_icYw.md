  Skeleton - https://giphy.com/gifs/tsY3xnzEvXdQRF4lXS ... If it's October 30th, it's
  Halloween again! It is a mood and a spooky time for skeletons, werewolves, frankensteins,
  draculas, vampires, witches and ghost and even ghouls to party. Download the gifs
  for cute halloween memes. They were made by Art House Politics, a channel on Left
  Tube (an online community of creators such as Contrapoints, hbomberguy and Shaun).
  These monsters appear in greeting cards in support of left wing, social justice
  and socialist demands such as believing survivors, transitioning to renewables,
  taxing the rich, and ending the wars.
