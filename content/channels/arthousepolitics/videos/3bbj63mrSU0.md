  ... Justice for Waluigi: A Gateway Cause that radicalize gamers around the world
  toward socialist demands. The shitpost was made by Art House Politics, a channel
  on Left Tube (an online community of creators such as Contrapoints, hbomberguy and
  Shaun). The #justiceforwaluigi meme is a rallying cry for Nintendo to include Waluigi,
  Mario Kart and Mario Tennis staple, to Super Smash Bros. He''s only been an assist
  trophy in Brawl, Smash 4 and Ultimate even though Wario is a playable character.
  Wah! The narrator''s rant devolves into anxiety about income inequality, capitalism,
  the gatekeeping of centrist liberal leaders such as Nancy Pelosi. Who knew video
  games were a political issue.'
