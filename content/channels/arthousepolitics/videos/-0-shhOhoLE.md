  Insta: https://www.instagram.com/arthousepolitics/ Review / film criticism of the
  surreal sci-fi movie Sorry To Bother You, directed by Boots Riley & starring Tessa
  Thompson & Lakeith Stanfield. A fail or "sin" for everything wrong with Sorry To
  Bother You in 6 minutes or less. (Numerals in titles increase engagement.) Cinema
  Fails is a Youtube empire not unlike WatchMojo, CinemaSins, video essayists or LeftTube
  titans like Contrapoints or Shaun. No association with Art House Politics. This
  video is satire therefore immune to criticism. Buy our T Shirts'
