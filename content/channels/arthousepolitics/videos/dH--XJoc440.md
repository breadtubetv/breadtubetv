  ... Anthropology Animals is a cute cartoon animation about the human condition,
  adding to an earlier video "The Moment Astrology Was Invented." It was made by Art
  House Politics, a creator on Left Tube - a video & meme space led by Contrapoints,
  hbomberguy and Shaun. The chill racoon and the cute, easily awed bird are good friends
  in a relaxing video set to Kirby music. It covers topics such as spirituality, astrology,
  mathematics, gender, language, and art.'
