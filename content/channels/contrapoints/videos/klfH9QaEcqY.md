  I’m back with some new ideas after a long hiatus from YouTube. As you can see, I’ve
  been working on some basic video editing skills, and I hope the increased time and
  effort makes for more pleasurable viewing. I’ve always deleted my past videos, mostly
  because they were improvised vlogs that I was rarely happy with in the long term.
  I’m hoping to produce some new work that I’ll feel confident leaving up permanently.
  Let me know what you think. Thunderf00t videos cruelly disparaged in this video:
  “Anita Sarkeesian WANTS women to manspread!” https://youtu.be/ZwhXbfsn24w “How Feminism
  destroyed ''New Atheism''” https://youtu.be/emrD6hTKkIY “Why ''feminism'' poisons
  EVERYTHING” https://youtu.be/FWxAljFlb-c Music credits: The Passion HiFi www.thepassionhifi.com
