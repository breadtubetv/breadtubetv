  Seeing: I think it was written as a counterpoint to a kind of excessive aestheticism
  that dominated art history in the 1950s, which was totally blind to social context.
  But today the students who were undergraduates when this book came out are now tenured
  professors, and in my opinion there’s now too much analysis of capitalism and gender
  in the humanities and not enough discussion of what actually makes art good. But
  I think that will probably be remedied when everyone gets sick of Marxist analysis
  and remembers that art can also be beautiful and strange and fun. Ideally, I think
  there’s room for both approaches. Sorry about the bad sound, I''ll have that improved
  in the next video. Music credits: The synthesized Beethoven is not, as you may have
  assumed, Wendy Carlos''s version from A Clockwork Orange, but my own soft synth
  version. The music at the beginning is a concerto grosso by Handel, a public domain
  performance from the European Archive.'
