  Big CW for this one for blood, but you can skip it from 5:00 to about 7:47, otherwise
  there will be discussion of police brutality and concentration camps, so feel free
  to give this one a miss if that''s not your thing. Also if there''s anything you
  want to ask me about the video or that you want me to clear up, just message me
  or comment here. Unfortunately I don''t have subtitles but please feel free to look
