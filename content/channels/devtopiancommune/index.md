      On this channel, we play mostly calm games that require little effort to edit because we are lazy comrade. Socialism and communism is mentioned a lot in videos mostly as an opportunity to seize a joke or two. Leftist informing videos as well as creative videos are uploaded on weekends whenever there is one. Hope you enjoy, comrade. Solidarity. ☭
