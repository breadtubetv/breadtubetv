      We are entering a period of profound economic, political and cultural crisis. In such periods it is essential for society to have the right theoretical tools for understanding our condition and how to change it. To this end, I began making these videos in the spring of 08 in order to try to explain some rather complicated theoretical ideas which I believe to be of utmost importance to our current condition.
      In times of crisis the law of value asserts itself with violence. My videos deal with the nature of value in a capitalist society, how this value is expressed, and what contradictions grow from it.

      I highly recommend David Harvey's Kapital class:
