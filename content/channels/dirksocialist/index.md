description: Greetings! I am Comrade Dirk and you are welcome to my channel 'Dirk
  Socialist' It may be no surprise that the channel Dirk Socialist is ran by a socialist.
description_more: Although to many the term 'Socialism' appears to be vulgar, I believe
  that most people would be interested in social ownership of the means of production
  if the idea were not so stigmatized. <br/><br/> As such, this channel is intended
  to instigating interesting discussion among the LeftTube community, as well as spread
  class consciousness. <br/><br/> Inspiration can be largely attributed to Flea Market
  Socialist and Art House Politics and motivation from Emerican and Luna from NonCompete
  and Luna Oi!, Cinema Knight , and Dumpster Flower. <br/><br/> Thank you all for
  your continued support. Please enjoy your stay. While you are here please like,
  share and subscribe-- it really does help. Take care, Comrades!
