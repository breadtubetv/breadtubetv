  Puppet Show demonstration with Puppeteer Erica Crooks ( The Erica Crooks Show /
  ericacrooks.com and officialericcrooks.com ) In this video Erica Crooks talks about
  how she goes about puppeteering which is a form of acting and performance art theater
  / acting , caricature of all levels , satirical comedy writing in a similar style
  to Spitting Image / Les Guignols De L''info / Mad Magazine / South Park , etc ,
  and performs some characters and political satire caricature puppets from The Erica
  Crooks Show ( President Donald J Trump , Conservative pundit Ben Shapiro , stupid
  republican and liberal voter stereotypes , Con ( Con & Spy Rotten aka Yeah Yeah
  Exactly Man ) , Religious right stereotype , etc ) . The caricatures of course are
  a work of satirical fiction and satire is a literary art form traditionally of leftist
  political ideology . In no means is this video or the satirical entertainment work
  of Erica Crooks is meant to libel or slander by any means. Satire is freedom of
  speech and opinion and has been around just about as long as the art form of puppetry
