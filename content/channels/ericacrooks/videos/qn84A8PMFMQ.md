description: 'From Transgender Lesbian filmmaker and satirist Erica Crooks comes the
  tale of Con & Spy Rotten finding true love and finally not being afraid of coming
  out which leads to finding true love and romance. This was never film so the audio
  remained and turned into sort of an audio movie which premiered on the second half
  of " The Eric Crooks Audio Broadcast of Satirical Comedy : Pride and Political Satire
  " http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/ericacrooks8 A wonderful audio movie that''s pro LGBTQ
  and at the same time a dark satire. For more information on Erica Crooks visit the
  Official Erica Crooks website on officialericcrooks.com'
