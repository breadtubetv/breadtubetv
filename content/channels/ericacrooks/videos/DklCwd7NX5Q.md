description: 'Spitting Image / Les Guignols : History and American Revivals News broke
  out from the BBC / BBC Arts that A NEW Spitting Image pilot was filmed and brand
  new Spitting Image puppets were made including Mark Zuckerburg , Kanye West , The
  Royals , Vladimir Putin ( as a small hand and rod puppet similar to David Steel
  ) and of course a EVEN MORE OUTRAGEOUS President Donald J Trump puppet EVEN more
  hilariously gross than the Les Guignols De L''info puppet. https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-49865406
  There has been news regarding “ AMERICAN “ versions of Spitting Image and Les Guignols
  De L’info ( canceled in 2018 ) . Spitting Image being revived by NBC https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7eR7-xUdhQ
  and Les Guignols being revived by FOX under the supervision of Robert Smigel . https://www.bubbleblabber.com/puppet-news-robert-smigel-producing-les-guignols-puppet-series-ron-burgundy-debuts-a-ventriloquist-act/
  The United Kingdom / France / Europe are known for their leftist and satire tradition
  unlike America with the acceptation of Mad Magazine . Dinosaurs in my opinion was
  the only satire / satirical puppet show that was even close to leaning leftist from
  time to time. American satirists are for the most part right wing libertarian /
  centrist / and occasionally liberal . Spitting Image in it’s heyday had the traditional
  leftist satirist vibe while going more liberal and turning into kind of a SNL entertainment
  like show during it’s final years including doing an advert for the Libertarian
  Party before they retired. Les Guignols De L’info has been the strongest Spitting
  Image inspired show . They were very leftist , even rougher and darker than Spitting
  Image , had a bigger budget than Spitting Image and lasted for 30 years. If an American
  Spitting Image / American Les Guignols became possible , the big question to ask
  is … ( 1. Would it be made by the original team like the original 3 NBC pilot specials
  in the 1980s ( Down and Out from The White House , The Ronnie and Nancy Show , The
  1987 Movie Awards ) as well as the American dubs of Les Guignols sketches before
  it’s cancelation seen on Dailymotion https://www.dailymotion.com/theguignols/videos
