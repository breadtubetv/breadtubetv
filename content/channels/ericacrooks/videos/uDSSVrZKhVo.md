description: The following video is just my fan opinions / concerns as a lifelong
  fan of The Jim Henson Company after they sold The Muppets to Disney . I feel that
  it wasn’t as creative as they were in the 1990s continuing the company after Jim
  Henson’s passing. Even though in society people would rather respectfully keep their
  opinions to themselves , I do stand up for the rights of fans in terms of how “
  Crass products “ is extremely exploitative . Even though most of the new stuff that’s
  coming of of The Jim Henson Company is either “ Blue low brow humor “ ( aka Henson
  Alternative ) or CGI or puppet Preschool educational shows for kids or these random
  books and products with Jim Henson’s name stamped on it ( just like The Walt Disney
  Company and Nickelodeon ) which have very little to do or ABSOLUTELY NOTHING AT
  ALL TO DO with Jim Henson and his creative legacy and style. Here’s my open letter.
  If you are a Jim Henson fan like me , then your probably just as annoyed as I am
  regarding what The Jim Henson Company has become since they sold The Muppets in
  2004. I understand that things weren't the same since Jim Henson's passing on May
  16th 1990 and there was many projects that were never made like Muppet High ( a
  rockabilly 1950s retro throwback Muppet show ) , Starboppers ( a Scifi spoof that
  teaches about consciousness , the Ego , etc AWESOME CONCEPT RIGHT ? ) but Dinosaurs
  did get made in 1991. The Wubbulous World of Dr Seuss ( season 1 ) was really creative
  blending both worlds together , cool cross-over. But what does The Jim Henson Company
  have left ? Just a handful of Jim's other work which only the stuff that's known
  has been properly released. Brian Henson admitted in an interview that the company
  is now " Preschool Entertainment " and seriously The Happytime Murders was a SLAP
  IN THE FACE to fans like me ! And what's up with junk like Sid the Science Kid ,
  Splash & Bubbles , Dinosaur Train , Henson Alternative , IT'S ALL CRAP and has NOTHING
  to do with Jim Henson and his spirit and his legacy. Seriously was buying The Charlie
  Chaplin studios worth giving up The Muppets to Disney to ruin ? My opinion is just
  shut everything down and just let it all be reserved by The Jim Henson Legacy for
  now. Screw Capitalism , Crass statements was something that Jim Henson was personally
  against ! Whatever is going on which seems at least to be ways to pay the bills
  , a lot of it is disrespectful to Henson fans and Jim Henson's legacy in my own
  opinion. The Happytime Murders and Henson Alternative has NOTHING to do with how
  the original Muppet Performers goofed around behind the scenes. Quit exploiting
  the fans and Jim Henson's name PLEASE ! _ Erica ( lifelong Jim Henson fan )
