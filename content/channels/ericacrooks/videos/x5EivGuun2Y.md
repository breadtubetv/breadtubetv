description: 'Culture of Hierarchy and the masses submissive / acceptance of it Anarchism
  is absolutely brilliant , so is New Age / New Thought Spirituality , and anything
  that relates to the beautiful heart , mind , body and soul of humanity. But the
  more hierarchy uses brainwashing technics to lie to people to agree on their side
  , as well as capitalism to block any chance for the working class intellectuals
  to get their point across or even listened to one person who could have the potential
  to spread the word of mouth and so on. What kind of sociopaths are having power
  over people ? Those in fear , that''s who. Fear of what ? Perhaps they became their
  own hate and fear unconsciously. But no matter how much work that needs to be done
  , the worst thing we can do is stop and think indifferent for a brighter tomorrow.
  Just know that even though someone can find happiness in the here and now , beware
  of the illusions by the ruling class that keep the masses submissive to them. In
  this video I also address on how some people could be influenced by arts and pop
  culture to help influence a social revolution while others might disagree completely
  with it. Does such hierarchical culture influence the habits of what people search
  for on the internet ? Another issue I''d like to cover in this very video or at
  least question it. #anarchy #anarchist #anarchism #thenewworldorder #newworldorder
