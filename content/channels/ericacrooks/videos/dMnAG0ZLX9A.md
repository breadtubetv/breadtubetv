description: Transgender people have been wrongfully stereotyped and discriminated
  through low brow prejudice stereotypes through out the history of comedy and sadly
  even today. So isn't it time that we throw away this negative image and say that
  this is just another blackface outdated. But still Transgender people in terms of
  equality should be included like everyone in comedy, but the joke isn't just because
  we are different but the critical judgement of one's character. That's what comedy
  should be about. Here's satirist, independent filmmaker, cartoonist, and multi-talented
  Transgender MTF Woman Lesbian " Erica Crooks presenting this video blog on Transgender
  vs Comedy and how comedy artists need to change perception to a more positive understanding
  in order to be funny. For more on the work of Erica Crooks, visit officialericcrooks.com
