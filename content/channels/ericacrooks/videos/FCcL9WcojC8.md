description: 'In this video I talk about my personal attraction to anarchism as well
  as how Libertarian Socialism can be attractive to INFPs and maybe other intuitive
  personality types as well as how it can be good for LGBTQ+ people too. Iâ€™m a transgender
  lesbian woman by the way. #INFP #transgender #anarchism'
