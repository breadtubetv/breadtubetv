type: video
description: '( Trigger Warning : Subject of Ableism ) In this video I wanted to talk
  about not only satire theory but also ableism ( discrimination of people with disabilities
  & mental illness ) In this video I talk about it in a general sense , more talking
  about disabilities. There''s a lot of discrimination towards people with disabilities
  . However satire / dark humor satire is known for subject matter that is taboo.
  It''s a good thing to be punching up instead of punching down. Satire is often a
  misunderstood art as well as literature , perhaps this is related with politics.
  Liberalism does it one way , however I am an Anarchist and a satirist. So these
  are some thoughts regarding the subject of satire mentioning ableism for now. _
