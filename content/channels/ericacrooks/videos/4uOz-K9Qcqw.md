description: 'iNuitive Bias is caused by Hierarchy , All political problems are. Left
  vs Right , Intuitives vs Sensors , Introverts vs Extroverts , Perceivers vs Judgers
  , Feelers vs Thinkers , liberals vs left wing progressives vs ( right wing ) libertarians
  . Equality doesn’t matter ignore the MBTI Myers Briggs Personality Type Test Indicator
  all together. Hierarchy simply means power over others. In an Anarchist Society
  / 5D Earth we could either use MBTI and many other methods such as the self determination
  theory and law of attraction to know we can create our own life without anyone telling
  us what to do as well as understanding one another’s differences in a positive humanitarian
  light . Hierarchy probably created the sensor dominated world which is the very
  isolation that develops so called “ iNtuitive Bias “ in the first place. Sometimes
  sensors need to learn from the intuitives ‘ point of view and if they truly dislike
  intuitives , know there’s a secret door to escape ( what was once referred to an
  unrealistic idealist utopia that’s actually TRUE ) for them too . Happiness is for
  everyone ! #mbti #myersbriggs #infp #infps #anarchy #anarchism #anarchist #anarchistsociety
