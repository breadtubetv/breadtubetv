description: 'Fellow INFPs , this video is for you . I cover things from my experience
  , things I’ve heard about regarding INFPs on the internet and perhaps even stereotypes
  of INFPs I bust . Remember , your not alone . And life can be wonderful if you allow
  it to be. Your all beautiful just the way you are. :) INFP : Wrong Planet ? Is INFP
  the most misunderstood personality type of Myers Briggs Personality Types ? Is INFP
  the most loneliest type not so much so a social life but perhaps being the #1 type
  who can care about humanity . Is INFP the most socially awkward unless interests
  are mentioned ? Is there a connection between INFP and Asperger’s Syndrome and other
  diagnoses from DSM Numerology ? Are INFP or some in fact light workers ? ( Which
  I’ve mentioned a bit in my video asking the question if INFP is considered to be
  the stereotype in the eyes of the public as a social justice warrior / special snowflake
  / butthurt crybaby ? ) Would INFPs rather live in the world of fantasy and just
  HATE Earth life so much ? Are there political / spiritual / philosophies that not
  only make the world a better place but finally a utopia idea for INFPs and intuitives
  alike . INFPs , Intuitives and the MBTI Message Forum Online Community , how they
  are perceived . Mentioning a couple of famous successful people with the INFP Myers
  Briggs / MBTI personality type and more . Presented by INFP Trans woman blogger
