type: video
description: The ENFP personality type is known for being one of the most friendliest,
  warn, cuddly ( at times ), and nicest personality types ever known to Personality
  Test Science. But like anybody, we do have our moments of handling stress. And ENFP
  stress handling isn't always a strength even to to most mature and personality growth
  developed ENFPs. ENFP Personality Type Vlogger Video Blogger Erica Crooks ( of officialericcrooks.com
  ) would like to talk about ENFP stress. ENFPs want things to be harmonious all of
  the time and sometimes when stressed or confused can blow things out of proportion
  and fear things negatively worse then it really actually is in reality. For more
  ENFP Personality Type and Personality Type related videos then subscribe to officialericcrooks
  and check out the " ENFP " playlists. Also visit the official Erica Crooks website
  for more fun knowledge about the ENFP personality type http://www.officialericcrooks.com/enfp-and-entp.html
  And for those other ENFP personality type individuals out there, make sure to spread
  the word and tell other ENFPs about these videos. ENFPs do love like minded people
  after all. :) If you can relate and would like to talk about your ENFP stress experience,
  have fun with the comments page below. Feel free to embed this video in ENFP / personality
  forums too. Share with other like minded ENFPs and subscribe. Thank you for watching
  and have a wonderful day. And try not to stress yourself out in life too much. :P
