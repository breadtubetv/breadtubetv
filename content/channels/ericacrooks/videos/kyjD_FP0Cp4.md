description: 'Negativity - What is it and what is it not There''s lots of teachers
  teaching The Law of Attraction , New Thought / New Age Spirituality . Some are good
  and some just do it for capitalism. I believe what " Negativity " refers to is more
  of the feeling state of " Bad Feeling Thoughts " as said in The Secret , Abraham
  Hicks , etc . However those who practice Law of Attraction should still take personal
  responsibility ( Body , Mind and Soul ) . Because what one person sees as being
  " Negative Energy " could actually be positive but they use Spiritual Bypassing
  to escape it. Not only is that''s not very mature but it just keeps negative karma
  attached and blocking positive manifestations from actually happening. That''s like
  if someone did not do any Karma clearing meditation methods when they are " TRIGGERED
  " and they just chill out and blame what''s outside of themselves as this negative
  thing that needs to be banned even though that''s only their perspective. That''s
  dangerous. Because Right Wing New Age people exist ! https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Age
  ( look on the section called " IDEAS " ) For example : Donald J Trump . He may have
  a wealthy mindset and manifested capitalism but he doesn''t care about how capitalism
  hurts everyone and it''s a hierarchical system made of hate and fear not prosperity
  like Anarchism . Someone could manifest getting away with crime and feel positive
  about anti-social behavior that hurts innocent people without caring. That doesn''t
  make it positive at all. And being ignorant and apolitical is nothing more but spiritual
  bypassing . Sure we all need to chill and enjoy the pleasures of life no matter
  where we are if it''s a good time with friends , or self , or your loved ones. But
  ignoring what''s outside of you isn''t positive thinking , that''s avoiding problems
  which need love to heal itself. Not loving hierarchical systems made by sociopaths
  but intuitively thinking without any limitations of our imagination on how " A New
  World Can Be Possible ". As for The Law of Attraction , I highly recommend this
  link as a research resource for more information. https://in5d.com/12-signs-that-youre-mastering-the-law-of-attraction/
