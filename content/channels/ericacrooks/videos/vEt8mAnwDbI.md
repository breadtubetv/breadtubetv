  I will be talking about the story behind the controversial legacy sketch From The
  Erica Crooks Show ( 2009 ) . https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68HVRGO0Mlo As well
  as the free web book in which I talk about it further . https://www.officialericcrooks.com/adults-get-bullied-too.html
  What was originally just a self parody dark comedy roast for my 21st resulted in
  a negative response. Including the cancellation of The Erica Crooks Show appearing
  on Public Access Television. ericacrooks.com ( Official Erica Crooks Personal Website
  ) officialericcrooks.com ( Official website of The Erica Crooks Show )
