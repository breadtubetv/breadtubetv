  YouTube Walkout December 10 - 13 ( credit to the original creators ) The download
  for the Walkout Package kit can be located right here ( as mentioned on the Twitter
  post ) . https://t.co/MUVq1Z7DT9?amp=1 Transcript of the video : YouTube is a platform
  owned by Google and strong armed often by its advertisers and the US government.
  Those who stand to lose every time Youtube has to cave in are its creators and viewers.
  No more. From December 10th to December 13th weâ€™re staging a walkout from the site.
  No watch views, no uploads, no engagement. Just stay out of YouTube. Let us not
  give them anything for three days. YouTube is nothing without creators and viewers,
  whether they are commercially viable or not. Enough, is enough. For those who are
  looking for my videos outside of YouTube , I would suggest the following. Erica
