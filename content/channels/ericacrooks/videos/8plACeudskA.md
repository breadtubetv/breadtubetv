description: The final episode from 2007 of The Eric Crooks Show created by Trans
  Woman filmmaker, comedian and puppeteer Erica Crooks . If you think The Erica Crooks
  Show puppets look primitive , just take a look 9 years ago. The very first film
  year of The Eric Crooks Show was in 2006 ( The Erica Crooks Show as of 2016 ) Celebrating
  10 Years of Erica Crooks comedy filmmaking and puppet / cartoon satire. For more
  information visit officialericcrooks.com today ! A sketch in this show featured
  a character's reaction to a Transgender Heterosexual Woman not understanding the
  fact that a Trans Woman Is a Woman who was born in the wrong body. This was a product
  of it's time. And is included as a piece of Erica Crooks history. This was made
  most likely in 2007. Ironically 6 years later, Erica realized she's in fact a Trans
  Woman Lesbian. Despite this sketch, this 2008 season would later explore androgyny
  and the LGBTQ in a positive light. In 2009, the show predicted Erica being a woman
  born in the wrong body. However the sketch in this episode is more on the uneducated
  character's reaction and not so much on the Trans character who didn't work on voice
  therapy. We are sorry to anyone who is offended , but as you can see, life out satired
  satire with irony on Erica's life shortly after this episode was made. Also in one
  of the last episodes of the 2007 season. A sketch pointed out Erica slowly coming
  out.
