description: 'Todayâ€™s episode with Gutian was recorded in two parts. The first before
  she posted her most popular video ever, An Open Letter to Big Breadtube. In part
  one we talk about the early stages of her channel. Then in a hastily recorded second
  part we talk about her video blowing up overnight, the responses it got, and where
  breadtube can go from here. Gutian''s channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCe4N2GAyLMCt1LPMvIAuoVQ
