description: Had a sitting US congresswoman on my stream to discuss Donkey Kong strategy
  recently. Here's the clip! I want to thank everyone who worked behind the scenes
  to make this stream happen, Pio, Dogstrong, Shaun, Foldable Human, Shannon Strucci,
  Rhods, Casey, everyone I didn't even know about, and in particular Chelsea Manning
  for everything that led up to this - this wouldn't have happened without all of
  your work and I love you for it If you would like to support someone who needs it,
  please check out the transcrowdfund hashtag. Even a small amount of money can help
  a real person get out of a bad situation and vastly improve their life. https://twitter.com/hashtag/TransCrowdFund?src=hash
