description: 'Let''s look at some studies into sexual assault and see how the smartest,
  most ''rational'' antifeminist on the internet debunks them, shall we? My Patreon:

  your name isn''t in the credits, it''s in the next one! SOURCES: https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/221153.pdf
  The CSA study - the originator of the 1 in 5 claim, and also by the way funded by
  the same department of justice that funded the one Sargon claims is somehow more
  factual. https://www.aau.edu/uploadedFiles/AAU_Publications/AAU_Reports/Sexual_Assault_Campus_Survey/AAU_Campus_Climate_Survey_12_14_15.pdf
  The survey Sargon thought was the 1 in 5 study, for some reason, and also misreads
  http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/rsavcaf9513.pdf The survey Sargon most likely
  barely read at all before concluding it was facts (I assume because, for methodological
  reasons he doesn''t understand, the resulting figures are lower than the other studies
  of this phenomenon) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6-Fz_VO_Ss Biden''s speech
  where he cites this statistic. It is very passionate and moving. I strongly recommend
  watching the whole thing, if you aren''t Sargon and have the time to actually watch
  things. He raises several actually-existing laws that still prevent the prosecution
  of rapists in various states across america. http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2014/may/02/are-20-percent-women-sexually-assaulted-they-gradu/
  Politifact checking Biden''s speech, concluding that it is consistent with other
  studies but has methodogical problems worth considering about how representative
  it is and that more study should be (and is being!) conducted. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NEx-qyZAmqs
  Obama''s message where he cites this statistic https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paa106OqXD4
  Sargon''s response to the ''myth''. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ekq3OLRz1ls
  Garrett''s response to Sargon where he also points out these problems, along with
  several more, and does it better than me http://www.virtualmuseumiraq.cnr.it/homeENG.htm
  The Virtual Museum of Iraq, which directly points out that it is impossible to tell
  if this is actually a statue of Sargon. Yet another source that I assume passed
  Carl by because it''s not on Wikipedia.'
