description: 'It''s only freedom of expression if you''re expressing butts. If you
  change your unfinished work, you''re a fascist. A butt fascist. Written by me and
  Klaus W. Art is by Klaus and animation is by me. Music''s from Incompetech. Screenshots
  are from various blogs and Reddits. My Twitter: https://twitter.com/hbomberguy My

  Because I now have quite a few Patrons I''ve split the credits in half, the others
  are going in the next video! Thanks again! I couldn''t afford to underpay Klaus
  for working on this without YOUR HELP! For extra fun, look up the ''comparisons''
  between the Spider-Woman and Spider-Man comic covers and note how, even though they''re
  in the same pose (and therefore clearly it''s all just feminazi whining), one cover
  was designed with a much more direct focus on the ass than the other. I wonder if
  you can guess which one that is?!!??'
