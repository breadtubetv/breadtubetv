description: 'This is a lecture I gave to students at the Hague about the ethics of
  using Artificial Intelligence in warfare. I haven''t given many lectures before,
  so I was a bit nervous! Thank you to everyone at THUAS for a wonderful time and
  your insightful questions! Disclosure: the university covered my expenses but otherwise
