description: 'We hit 10K subs a while ago, so I did a Google hangout to say thank
  you and answer questions. This is the edited version, I cut some questions if they
  were ones that I couldn’t really answer properly, or if the recording was too sketchy,
  or if I''d answered them elsewhere before. Thanks to everyone who turned up! Discussion
  includes the role of physics, the ethics of owning a pet, absurdism, YouTube "fame",
  travel, philosophy A-level and my favourite novel! The last hangout I did: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udphgph_1tE
