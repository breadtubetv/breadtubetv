  and also here for more detail on Objectivism: http://tinyurl.com/zn9my7d Susan Brownmiller,
  Against Our Will (Brownmiller’s book is about rape, and the study of rape has certainly
  moved on since it came out – particularly her bits about animals are not thought
  highly of now. However, it does contain an analysis of the rape-ier bits of Rand.)
