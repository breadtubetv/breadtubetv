description: 'Some fans tell me that philosophy makes them sad, especially existentialists
  like Satre and Camus, and especially if it impacts their religious faith. So if
  studying it makes you depressed, anxious, or lonely, here''s a story to help you
  feel better, and some chat about the wonder of learning! Patreon: http://www.patreon.com/PhilosophyTube
