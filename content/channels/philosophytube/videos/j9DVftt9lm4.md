description: 'Something a little different! A Philosofan recommended an online video
  game to me called ''Socrates Jones: Pro Philosopher'' in which you play as a character
  examining the arguments of famous philosophers, Phoenix Wright-style. So I made
  a Let''s Play video of it! This is just the first tutorial level; if you want to
  see more let me know! Thanks to Meophist for recommending it! Watch the whole series:
