  Many people asked me about Fidel. Because my channel is not a news channel and so
  many others already made videos about Fidel I didn't feel like it was necessary
  to make a video about his death. Needless to say he was a great revolutionary &
  anti-imperialist hero, and a great example to all of us Communists. History has
  absolved him.
