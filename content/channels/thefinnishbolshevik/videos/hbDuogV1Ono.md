title: Response to Libertarian Socialist Rants & "Red Bureaucracy"
date: "2019-09-15T10:39:15+08:00"
description: 1. Anarchists need to define exactly what they mean by Worker Control
  instead of sticking to their usual axiom "its what ever we do and not what Marxists
  do". 2. Anarchism needs to demonstrate that it can reach stateless communism. Otherwise
  its fairly pointless to complain that Marxism hasn't done so, especially since Marxism
  never claimed to reach statelessness immediately unlike Anarchism. Marxism has a
  rational theoretical explanation for why Socialist states and Anarchist societies
  didn't achieve statelessness but Anarchist ideology is clueless about it instead
  opting for denial. This makes Anarchism a purely faith-based ideology. 3. Anarchism
  has consistently failed to protect itself and instead of taking a look in the mirror
  always blames all of it's mistakes on everyone else. Marxists recognize the harm
  hostile forces have caused to Socialism and how Socialism has been hindered by it's
  enemies but such resistance is to be expected and we need to be able to live with
  it. Anarchists should learn this simple truth instead of screaming "unfair" and
  rage quitting at the first sign of trouble. See my videos on CNT-FAI, Makhnovism
  and Withering Away of the State for more information and sources for claims specifically
  relating to those topics. Apart from that sources are mentioned in the video itself.
