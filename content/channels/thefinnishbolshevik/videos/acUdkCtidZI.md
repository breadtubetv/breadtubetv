title: Long Rebuttal of Trotskyist Nonsense
date: "2019-09-15T10:39:10+08:00"
description: 'Rather long rebuttal of a lecture given by Alan Woods, a prominent Trotskyist.
  I randomly came across this video and found it particularly irritating and just
  decided to respond to. I also came across Alan Woods'' material on multiple occasions
  while researching my previous video on Trotskyism so I was getting a bit fed up
  with him and his nonsense. Original lecture: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ZICRekmCE
  All the sources for my claims about Trotsky are in my previous Trotskyism video.
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMq9GePJut4 This video is a work of criticism and
  analysis and falls under Fair Use.'
