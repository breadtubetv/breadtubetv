description: 'The New Colossus: Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame, With conquering
  limbs astride from land to land; Here at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall stand
  A mighty woman with a torch, whose flame Is the imprisoned lightning, and her name
  Mother of Exiles. From her beacon-hand Glows world-wide welcome; her mild eyes command
  The air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame. “Keep, ancient lands, your storied
  pomp!” cries she With silent lips. “Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled
  masses yearning to breathe free, The wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send
  these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden door!”
