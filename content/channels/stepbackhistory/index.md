      Are you a fan of history, but sick of the history channel? Step Back is the place for you.

      Step Back is a history channel that invites you to consider the past and how it connects to today. We make videos that take a historical topic and look at it from a new angle. We find those gems that your history channels would overlook. We search for the quirky, unconventional, and just plain weird parts of our collective story.

      If that sounds like your bag, sit back, fire up a video, and if you like what you see, subscribe for more.
