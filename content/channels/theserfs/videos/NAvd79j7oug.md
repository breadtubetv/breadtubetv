description: 'When the requirements to be James Bond are being suave, good looking,
  and British why is it so surprising that it be suggested Idris Elba play the titular
  character? We debunk the theory and history behind it. Correction: User Natesh Mayuranathan
  pointed out that Ben Kingsley was in fact half Indian (Gujarati) so the accusation
  of brown face is completely unwarranted. One of the two Serfs who run this channel
  and podcast is Indian himself so he''s doubly ashamed. If you enjoy what you see
