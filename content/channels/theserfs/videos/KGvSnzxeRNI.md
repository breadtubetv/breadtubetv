type: video
description: 'The Death of Stalin is another hilarious satire by Armando Lannucci,
  but is it historically accurate? We separate fact from fiction in this exploration
  of the film. Corrections: It''s Concerto N.23 not N.3 and thanks to Tim Stone for
  pointing that out. It''s ''conclave'' not ''enclave'' and Beria was shot and then
  shot. Thanks for Rick Jones for pointing that out. If you enjoy what you see and
