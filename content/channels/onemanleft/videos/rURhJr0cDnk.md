description: Times coming for that ax to fall, somebody's gonna have to pay the piper
  when he calls. the worlds burning baby, lets have a ball. We'll go dancing on the
  ashes..and then, build a better world on top of the smoldering coals.. the only
  answer is to dismantle the whole goddamn thing build it up from the bottom and start
  over clean.. foster a culture of inclusive equality to right the wrongs of this
  society ..but, until then let's douse this place in gasoline! Times coming for some
  heads to roll.. the rich and powerful will pay for what they've done to us all..
  dust off your guillotine and let's have ball.. we're gonna dance while the guillotine
  sings and build a better world on top of their severed skulls! the only answer is
  to dismantle the whole goddamn thing! build it up from the bottom and start over
  clean.. foster a culture of inclusive equality, to right the wrongs of this society,
  and forge a future that resembles our wildest dreams.. until then let's douse this
  place in gasoline!
