    description: Filling in gaps in your political lexicon one video at a time. This
      channel will be dealing in framing topics under Cognitive Psychology in a Leftist
      lens. The mental mechanics of some of the things discussed on other channels,
      and how it can be easy to fall into some mental pitfalls. It happens to everybody,
      don't worry so much about it. Being better often is more about being aware that
      it can happen than being perfect every time.
