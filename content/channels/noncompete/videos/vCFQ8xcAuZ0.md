description: 'Finally: a Halloween song for anarchists, communists, and puppets! Lyrics:
  Spooky scary socialists Shall seize the sovereign state Working proles will shock
  your soul Seal your class’s fate Spooky scary socialists In solidarity Marxists
  marching arm in arm Together can’t be beat Sorry bout this, capitalists You have
  had your fun Now it’s time to socialize The means of production Cause spooky scary
  socialists Shout “Workers all unite!” We’ll come together, raise our fists And demonstrate
  our might Silly centrist liberals Support the status quo But leftists won’t be satisfied
  Until its overthrown! Spooky scary socialists Are silly all the same We’ll dance
  and sing on Halloween And play our waiting game For Fascists might be laughing now
  But we can never lose Spooky scary socialists Will rise up with a boo! Original
