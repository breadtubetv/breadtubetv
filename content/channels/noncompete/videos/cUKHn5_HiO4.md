  power or internet at my apartment until I started live streaming :D We''ll try to
  do a followup asap to finish the conversation. Thanks for watching while you could!
  I will be holding a live stream interview with vegan Alex Krasny as a followup to
  our previously recorded interview. We will be addressing questions and comments
  from the audience as well as issues related to cultivated identity, gatekeeping,
  and the connections between veganism and leftism. Original Interview: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiCd188GDxs
