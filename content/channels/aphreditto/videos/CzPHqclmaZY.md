  and Minimalist mix by Aphreditto. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Made a short mix this week. I felt David Graeber''s talk was a nice introduction
  to Rojava. Also, I felt like changing the music up with some laid back Drumcode.
  I hope you enjoy :) ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
