description: 'Thomas Merton on the Church as Institution, featuring a short Chill
  Trap/Bass mix by Aphreditto ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Short lecture this week. I hope you enjoy this section of an AMA Thomas Merton did
  with an order of nuns. I''m not sure what will be coming next. I''m hoping to do
  a pacifist reading soon from Simone Weil, but I also want to do a mix with a reading
  of Abdullah Ã–calan''s Democratic Confederalism. I will be traveling this week so
  I will have time to plan out the next few mixes. In the meantime though, let me
  know if you enjoyed Merton. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
