description: 'Yanis Varoufakis on the EU, Democracy, Capitalism, and Bankroptocracy,
  featuring a Psybass mix by Tryptophant. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  A bit of a different perspective this week. I feel that Varoufakis''s perspective
  on the state of the world economy is very apt. I have also been working on a Noam
  Chomsky mix on the subject of Turkish state terror, but the task of making Chomsky''s
  voice audible to the human ear has been mind boggling. I know not what sorcery to
  use. Anyway, enjoy this week''s mix and have a nice week, lovlies. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
