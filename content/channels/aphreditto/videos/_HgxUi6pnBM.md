  This one, I feel, is a nice introduction to the thoughts presented in The Conquest
  of Bread by Peter Kropotkin. It is not a replacement for actually reading the bread
  book though so I highly recommend that you do so regardless! You can find my version
  of it here: https://youtu.be/_0h4xRqzR6A ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
