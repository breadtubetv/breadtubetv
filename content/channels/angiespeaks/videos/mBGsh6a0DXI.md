description: Come Join in the fun as I shoot the shit with Michael Saba, a fellow
  leftist YouTuber, with a background in Journalism and a flair for sharp media critique.
  We will be discussing his time spent in Russia, The Politics of Electronic Music,
  the strange phenomena of "Wokewashing" in media and art, Bad Pop Culture of the
  12st Century and Social Media and Mental Health. Michael worked for CNN and was
  then swiftly spirited away to Russia where he worked for RT and was privy to the
  strange machinations of the East VS West media apparatus. His channel "Michael Saba"
  is one of my fave places on youtube! It focuses primarily on critical analysis of
  pop culture artifacts from a leftist perspective. If you've heard of him, lucky
  you, If not, It's because he doesn't whore himself out on social media like the
  rest of us! . His channel is a wonderful place, one that I feel a deep affinity
  towards and I'm proud to introduce him to you all today
