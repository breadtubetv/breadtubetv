type: video
description: 'Who Are Black Leftists Supposed to Be?" is a satirical take on the alienation
  sometimes felt by black leftists within predominantly white middle class leftists
  spaces. This video is an analysis of class and race and how those intersections
  often go ignored within certain areas of the left. Big thanks to Peter Coffin and
  Eastern Marsh Lands for helping me with this video! Music: "Graduation March" "Thieving
  Magpie" "Baba It Will Be Ok" - Dr.Doctor "I Got Life" - Nina Simone - Cover by Angie
