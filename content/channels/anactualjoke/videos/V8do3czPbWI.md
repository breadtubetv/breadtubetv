description: 'TW: This video contains some slurs and hateful language in screenshots.
  Viewer discretion advised I am aware Mirrors are annoying, but this happened to
  a friend of mine, and I don''t want to see him censored/ kicked off the platform.
  If you want to, consider mirroring the video I understand that the use of triggering
  is not cool, but I don''t remember if that is critiqued in this video or not, either
  way. Consider watching and subbing to Anti-Social Media. Ok. So my Friend Anti Social
  Media made a video critiquing TJ Kirk, Aka the amazing atheist. TJ''s fans, or someone,
  flagged ASM''s video, and ASM now has a strike on his channel. Please consider subscribing
  to ASM, while he''s not as far left as I am, or my content, I consider a lot of
  his work funny/ valuable as a voice. Please consider giving him a watch (I''m gonna
  be working with him to help him improve his production values, bc he has a lot of
  good things to say) https://youtube.com/AntiSocialMedia ORIGINAL DESCRIPTION: (approximation)
  For a man who prides himself on ''Triggering'' smaller youtubers, TJ Kirk gets incredibly
  angry at the opinions of ASM, a smaller youtuber.'
