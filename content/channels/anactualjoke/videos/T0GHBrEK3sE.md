type: video
description: 'In this video, we’re discussing the merits of three different approaches
  to liberation politics. Liberal IDPOL, Class Reductionism, and Intersectional Socialism.
  I hope y''all enjoy this video. I worked hard on it. The sound effects are inconsistent,
  because I wanted to put this out now. Next one is way shorter, and is almost done.
  It''s one from an archive that I''m gonna release, and the video after that is almost
  done script writing. Oh yeah, I wrote this with Ameera W. | FKA Squid Kid I mentioned
  some articles, but I only remembered to grab this link. Transcript and other articles
  coming soon. http://blackyouthproject.com/yes-black-people-commodify-black-lives-matter-too-and-its-a-major-problem/
