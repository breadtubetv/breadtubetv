description:
  This part of the film looks at the approach of the western imperialist bourgeoisie
  to our period of global imperialist competition, considering two main trends - broadly, those who believe this period is a second "Cold War", and those who know it is a third World War.
  
  A Dying Culture is a feature length Marxist-Leninist documentary, looking
  at art, culture, the state, postmodernism, video games, social media, war and crisis.
