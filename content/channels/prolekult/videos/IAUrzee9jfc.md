description: 'Selling Extinction is a short introduction to the capitalist notion
  of a "Green New Deal", the NGOs that support it and the recent Extinction Rebellion
  protests in London. #SocialismorExtinction Support us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/prolekult

  --- We recommend our viewers look into some of the excellent work that has already
  been produced on the Green New Deal. Cory Morningstar''s series on the NGO push
  for the financialisation of nature is a very thorough starting point. http://www.wrongkindofgreen.org/2019/01/17/the-manufacturing-of-greta-thunberg-for-consent-the-political-economy-of-the-non-profit-industrial-complex/
  We would also recommend checking of the recently founded Green Anti-Capitalist Front
  and their upcoming events. Their manifesto is an important development and demonstrates
  the real potential of building a movement against imperialism''s destruction of
  the earth. https://greenanticapitalist.org/'
