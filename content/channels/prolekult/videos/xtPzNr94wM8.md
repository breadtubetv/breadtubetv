description: 'History is Marching is a feature length documentary analyzing the rise
  in tensions between major world powers of the course of 2018. This section of the
  film analyses the significance of Donald Trump''s Presidency in the United States
  as a political expression of its crisis. Since the end of the world wars, the US
  has held an unquestionably dominant position in the world economy. This is now coming
  to an end. The rise of the so called "developing" nations and the intention of the
  EU, Russia and China to de-dollarise their economies means this cannot continue
  indefinitely. Trump''s response to this is uncompromising in his approach to foreign
  policy. He is everywhere aggressively asserting the US'' imperialist interests.
