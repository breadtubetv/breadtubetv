description: 'History is Marching is a feature length documentary analyzing the rise
  in tensions between major world powers of the course of 2018. This part of the film
  looks at the political and economic crisis of British imperialism. Since the world
  wars, Britain has largely maintained its alliances with both Europe and the US to
  its own advantage, allowing it to retain itself as an independent economic power
  and the City of London as a leading financial centre. Today, however, this is becoming
  untenable. With lines hardening between the US and the EU, Britain was forced to
  pick a single alliance. This rendered the British ruling class split and unable
  to decide, forcing the 2016 Brexit referendum. This has result in an all but complete
  political crisis amongst the British ruling-class, which is still deepening. Increasingly,
  Britain is becoming desperate. Enter Sergei Skripal. Please consider supporting
