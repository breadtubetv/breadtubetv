description:
  This part of the film looks at data extraction and how this is monetized, first
  through a history of Google - the first company to monetise this resource. It then
  discusses the significance of data in general, its relationship to capital, the
  predatory techniques by which it is secured and state intervention into the tech
  industry.
  
  A Dying Culture is a feature length Marxist-Leninist documentary, looking
  at art, culture, the state, postmodernism, video games, social media, war and crisis.
