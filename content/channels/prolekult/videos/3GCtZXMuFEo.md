description: 'History is Marching is a feature length documentary analyzing the rise
  in tensions between major world powers of the course of 2018. This part of the film
  ties together the analysis developed in previous parts to understand Trump''s withdrawal
  from the Intermediate Nuclear-Forces Treaty, and France and Germany''s call for
  an independent European Army in November 2018. It argues that economic conditions
  today are clearly leading the world''s major powers into open confrontation. That
  this could spiral into a third world war is already being treated as a living element
  of US military policy and strategy. In seeing this, we must understand that there
  can be only one response: socialism. Please consider supporting our work on Patreon:
