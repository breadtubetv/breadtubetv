description: 
  This part of the film looks at the crisis today faced by imperialist society - that
  is, its final crisis. After briefly outlining this, it goes on to argue that this
  signifies the end of the material basis necessary for postmodern hegemony, and is
  leading to ideological crisis.
  
  A Dying Culture is a feature length Marxist-Leninist documentary, looking
  at art, culture, the state, postmodernism, video games, social media, war and crisis.
