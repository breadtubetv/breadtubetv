description: 'History is Marching is a feature length documentary analyzing the rise
  in tensions between major world powers of the course of 2018. This part of the film
  looks at developments in the European Union since Trump began to assert the US''
  interests in Europe a more concerted way in mid-2018. It traces the intent of a
  faction of the European Commission, led by Germany and France, to consolidate the
  EU as a bloc capable of competing with the US. This process is fraught with difficulties
  and political barriers, largely owing to the EU''s nature as an alliance of disparate
  interests. Please consider supporting our work on Patreon: https://patreon.com/prolekult
