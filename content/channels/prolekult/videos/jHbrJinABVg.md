description: "Madrugada is a very quick look at class struggle across the globe, particularly
  France and Bolivia, intended to emphasise the importance of anti-imperialism in
  our present context. It is the last of our short videos for the year. We'll be looking
  at the swathes of protest noted in more detail next year. Thank you for all your
  support and solidarity. Hands off Bolivia! No to the coup! Solidarity to the gilet
  jaunes! Workers, oppressed and indigenous unite! Support us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/prolekult
