  This part of the film looks at the political style of Donald Trump - the first authentic "social media" politician in the West - as a symptom of an historical age of farce. This section also considers postmodern fascism as a political phenomenon and contains images any human being should rightly find distressing.
  
  A Dying Culture is a feature length Marxist-Leninist documentary, looking
  at art, culture, the state, postmodernism, video games, social media, war and crisis.
