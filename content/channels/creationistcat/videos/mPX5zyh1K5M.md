  2018" A word about InfoWars getting banned from Vadim: Hey guys, before we begin
  the festivities I, CC’s humble human slave would just like to say a few words about
  Alex Jones and his channel being removed. Uhhh, it’s no secret I loathe the horrible
  disinformation this man has unleashed on the world, his lies, his slandering of
  good people. The violence his paranoia has perpetuated. I think he’s basically a
  human bucket of donkey shit, apologies if that’s insulting to donkey shit. In fact,
  I’m not a violent guy, but I’ve long said that if there was some sort of situation
  where I absolutely had to punch one person in all of politics and pop culture— if
  it was like a ‘punch someone or I’ll shoot this adorable puppy, kitten a baby seal
  and your first born child right in front of you” type situation, it would definitely
  be Alex Jones. In a heartbeat. Wouldn’t have to think twice about it. That being
  said, even though there may be sufficient reasons for his removal, I’m sure he may
  have genuinely broken terms of service due to a number of things he’s said, done,
  instigated and lied about, I have to say this STILL does not sit well with me. It’s
  a scary precedent that I believe is being set. I think that if he can go after all
  this time many channels on the left and the right can go as well. This channel currently
  has a strike for a video we made over five years ago that advertised a Doctor’s
  without Border’s charity campaign and we merely said the word Boner several times
  and showed a picture of soccer players with super tight shorts for like five seconds,
  so as a content creator I worry about what this could mean for dozens of channels
  I love as well as my own. It’s possible I feel this way purely due to undue paranoia
  that I feel as a creator and for my youtube creator friends. I realize that and
  all that being said, maybe I’ll change my mind on this one so don’t freak out if
  you feel otherwise. Let’s agree to disagree and let’s have some fun taking a stroll
  down memory lane and watching all the InfoWars related content we’ve had on the
  channel over the years… There’s a guide in the Christ-box in case you’ve already
  watched one and want to skip ahead. Enjoy and later shodomites!!!'
