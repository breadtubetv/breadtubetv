  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Victor Grossman,
  born Stephen Wechsler, a New York red-diaper baby of the 1930s, joined the Communist
  Party as a Harvard student. Fleeing the U.S. Army during the McCarthy Era, he swam
  the Danube River to the Soviet Zone of Austria and was sent to East Germany. There,
  he studied journalism and became a freelance writer and popular speaker. He was
  pardoned by the U.S. Army in 1994 and, in 2003, published an autobiography, Crossing
  the River: A Memoir of the American Left, the Cold War, and Life in East Germany
  ((U. of Mass.Press). Victor Grossman will be visiting Washington, DC from May 15-May
  18 on a national book tour of his latest book weighing problems of GDR socialism
  and modern capitalism entitled A Socialist Defector: From Harvard to Karl-Marx-Allee
  by Monthly Review press.'
