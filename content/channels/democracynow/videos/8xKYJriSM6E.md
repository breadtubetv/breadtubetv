type: video
description: 'Not paying Uber drivers so that they can''t afford a home and have to
  live in a tent, or they can''t afford a decent living even if they have home, that''s
  what''s necessary so that the Uber founder, the head of the company, can live in
  a $72.5 million mansion... You tell me what your ethics, your religion and your
  morality suggest is the way to go here." This clip comes from the episode titled
  "Reparations and Forgiving Student Debt." Watch the entire episode here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGWusrf6NC4&t=1084s
