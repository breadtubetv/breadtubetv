  suffered not just another economic downturn (they have that in capitalism every
  4 to 7 years) but a real big one where millions of people lose their jobs, not for
  six months, not for 18 months but for years on end, whenever that has happened you
  begin to see anxiety. And you see two kinds of anxiety. One: "We have to do something
  to save capitalism. It''s in mortal danger". That''s one reaction. That''s where
  fascism lies." Watch entire episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O05wS7w4aEw&t=1208s
