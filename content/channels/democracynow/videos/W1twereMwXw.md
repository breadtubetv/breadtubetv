  Bartlett and Nati Lombardo from the Loomio team are partnering up with Democracy
  at Work Los Angeles Action Group to offer a co-created workshop on collaborative
  culture and non-hierarchical organizing. We combine storytelling and participation
  to learn together about democratic, bottom-up organizing at different scales: from
  co-ops, to networks, cities and nations. We''ll offer some practices and tools that
  have helped us, and discover the intelligence in the room too. Rich and Nati have
  been engaged in the craft of participatory organizing for more than five years,
  starting with Occupy in 2011, co-founding Loomio (a worker co-op building software
  for collective decision-making) and Enspiral (a network of 250 tech activists experimenting
  with radical organizational forms). For more information: www.loomio.coop www.enspiral.com
