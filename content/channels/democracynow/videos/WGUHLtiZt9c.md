  has become confused and confusing. Too many different definitions make honest, balanced
  discussions and evaluations of these alternative systems difficult. Because socialism

  to understand and engage "capitalism versus socialism." Watch entire episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBRhTnswnv0&t=186s
