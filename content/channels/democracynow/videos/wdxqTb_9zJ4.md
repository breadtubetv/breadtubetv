  in America is in the US household. This podcast exposes the class underbelly of
  revolutionary struggles around abortion rights, paid maternity leave and family
  leave. Lost abortion rights and no paid maternity or family leaves keep women from
  advancing at work as they take time to care for children. Abortion and family leaves
  are sites of the revolutionary struggle for Americaâ€™s personal and family life.
