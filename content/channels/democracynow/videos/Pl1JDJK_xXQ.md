  big banks literally did every illegal and unethical thing imaginable. They manipulated
  interest rates (the LIBOR scandal), they got caught manipulating foreign exchange
  rates, they got caught charging people for fees they shouldn''t have, they got caught
  mismanaging the mortgage crisis, you name it. Oh I forgot laundering criminal money.
  Shouldn''t forget that. They got caught. They paid billions in fines. After a record
  ten years like that the "logical" thing is to give them less regulation. I told
  you it''d take your breath away." We make it a point to provide the show free of
