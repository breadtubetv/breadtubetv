  Alex Vitale is professor of sociology and coordinator of the Policing and Social
  Justice Project at Brooklyn College. He has spent the last 25 years consulting police
  departments and human rights groups internationally. In his new book, "The End of
  Policing," he argues that the bulk of liberal police reforms currently being considered
  in the US are either ineffective or counterproductive and what''s really needed
  is a dramatic reduction in our reliance on police. .'
