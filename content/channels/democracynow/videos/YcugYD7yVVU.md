  The latest episode of Left Out will be released this Thursday 12/21/17. For this
  episode, we sat down with Christian Parenti to discuss climate change and our current
  political landscape. Parenti is a sociologist trained at the London School of Economics
  and is currently an economics professor at John Jay College (CUNY). In our interview,
  we were able to ask Christian what it was like to straddle the realm between academia
  and journalism; prospects of climate catastrophe; climate change and justice; and
  the role of both politics and the state in any real solutions for a way forward.
  Links to Christian Parenti''s recent work: Tropic of Chaos: Climate Change and The
  New Geography of Violence; Anthropocene or Capitalocene?: Nature, History, and the
  Crisis of Capitalism.'
