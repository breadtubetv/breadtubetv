  Please hit the red SUBSCRIBE button above. ^^^ Prof. Wolff presents updates on (1)
  the US public education crisis (teacher strikes, declining quality, insufficient
  resources) and how it undermines the US''s economic future, (2) the absurdity of
  the government shutdown over an ineffective wall and a tiny portion of the government''s
  budget, and (3) how the schools crisis and the shutdown signal a larger social decline.
  The second part of the show features an interview with Professor Alex Vitale on
  his book, The End of Policing, and why US police have grown and changed their functions
  so drastically in recent decades. To watch the full episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiQ_I6X80vI&t=1078s

  Alex Vitale is professor of sociology and coordinator of the Policing and Social
  Justice Project at Brooklyn College. He has spent the last 25 years consulting police
  departments and human rights groups internationally. In his new book, "The End of
  Policing," he argues that the bulk of liberal police reforms currently being considered
  in the US are either ineffective or counterproductive and what''s really needed
  is a dramatic reduction in our reliance on police.'
