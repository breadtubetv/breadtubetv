type: video
description: 'This is crazy, what we''re doing. Our problem isn''t monopoly or competition.
  Our problem is a system that displays the transition from one to the other, during
  which we are overcharged for the monopolized goods, overcharged for the legal shenanigans
  in which they argue with each other for the umpteenth time. How many times do you
  need to get ripped off before you recognize a ripoff?" Watch the entire episode
