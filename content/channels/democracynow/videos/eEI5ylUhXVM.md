  Group: http://action.democracyatwork.info/losangeles --- Professor Wolff speaks
  to the attendees of Democracy at Work Los Angeles'' fundraiser in April of 2017.
  Part 1 of 2. Democracy at Work Los Angeles is a local volunteer action group, working
  to further the goals of the national org directly in our community. We wish to see
  more worker co-ops in LA, legislation and anchor groups which favor their existence,
  and more schools which teach them as a viable business alternative. We hold monthly
  meetings, create content, build connections, and generally exist as a hub for collaboration,
  a platform for action, and voice calling for a cultural shift towards democracy
  in the workplace. --- Video shot and edited by Mansoor Sabbagh, director of Global
  Voices for Justice: globalvoicesforjustice.org'
