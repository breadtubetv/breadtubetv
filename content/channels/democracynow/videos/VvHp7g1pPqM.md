  the struggle between those holding on to former gender roles with women serving
  men and children and those recognizing the opportunity that we now have to be equal
  partners in the home and at work. Movements like #Metoo or #Timesup, March for Women,
  or abortion rights, and many more, support the conditions of existence for equal
  partnership. This is a moment of gender struggle that surrounds all of us in the
  USA today. Follow us ONLINE: Websites: https://www.democracyatwork.info/capitalismhitshome
