  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Neha Mathew-Shah
  is President of Progressive Workers Union (PWU) and currently employed with the
  Sierra Club as an International Environmental Justice Representative. As a non-profit
  employee for over seven years, Neha has experienced the power of working with a
  union to build a powerful, equitable and inclusive environment both inside and outside
  the workspace. At Sierra Club, this change has been driven by two unions that represent
  the two-thirds of the organizations employees, PWU and Sierra Employee Alliance
  (SEA).'
