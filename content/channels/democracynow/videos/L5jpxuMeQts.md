  E12] Clip In the full episode, Dr. Fraad talks about the re-emergence of the Womenâ€™s
  Movement. Unlike the 1960s and 1970s, the need for basic economic change applies
  to both men and women together rather than women versus men, one gender versus the
  other. The American economic boat is sinking: men and women are drowning together.
  Only a movement unified around class differences and addressing all issues together
  will have a chance to win the lasting change we need. Follow us ONLINE: Patreon:
