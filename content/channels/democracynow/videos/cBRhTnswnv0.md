  Socialism This week on Economic Update, Professor Wolff does something a little
  different. He dives deep into the 200+ year old debate and struggle between capitalism
  and socialism and looks into how it has become both confused and confusing. The
  different definitions of these systems make honest, balanced discussions and evaluations
  of them increasingly more difficult. Now that socialism is rising yet again to challenge
  capitalism, the debate demands a closer examination of the terms and their numerous,
  new and different meanings. Read the full transcript of this episode: https://www.democracyatwork.info/eu_capitalism_vs_socialism
