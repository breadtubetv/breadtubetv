description: '[S1 E26] Jeffrey Epstein: Literal Rape by the 1% - Part 2 Thank you
  for supporting Capitalism Hits Home on Patreon! Your support helps us compensate
  the staff and additional workers it takes to put an episode together. Thank you
  for being a part of the CHH team! This episode explores the ways that shame is transferred
  from rapists, corporate heads and exploiters on to the women they rape and the people
  they exploit. It discovers some of the ways that shame is being shifted back on
  to the shoulders of male sexual predators and capitalist predators with their "friends"
  in government. Read the full transcript here: https://www.democracyatwork.info/chh_jeffrey_epstein_part_2
