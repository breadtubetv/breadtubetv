  improving the health of everybody. You give everybody Medicare you''re improving
  the health of everybody. That makes workers more productive, that makes families
  hold together, that makes the society work better and it saves a ton of money in
  medical care because you''ve taken care of people from the beginning of their lives.
  That''s why every other industrial developed country does that (provide medical
  insurance for everybody) not out of the goodness of their souls but out of the practical
  benefits." We make it a point to provide the show free of ads. Please consider supporting
