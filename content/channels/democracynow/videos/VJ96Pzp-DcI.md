  always has. You identify something in the society that needs fixing and then you
  fix it. You come up with a better way of doing it, a better way of thinking about
  it, a better way of approaching a problem. That''s why we don''t rub sticks together
  to make a fire. We''ve learned something. And that was because people early on said
  "there must be a better way to start a fire than spending all this time rubbing
  these two damn wet sticks together". Well if you don''t criticize capitalism in
  school you''ll prevent people from learning to think critically about their system
  and that undercuts progress." Support the show! Become an EU patron on Patreon:
