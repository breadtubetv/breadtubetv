type: video
description: '''We bailed out (the people did) Wall Street back in 2008, 2009 and
  2010. It''s time for Wall Street to bail out the American student.'' So is it economically
  feasible? Sure it is. But here''s something to think about... If you want to really
  deal with this problem you''ve got to change who gets paid what and what costs what,
  or else the debt is always gonna come. And you''re gonna have those angry people
  with home debt and car debt and credit card debt asking: "why help the students
  and not me? Good for the students, but I want my debts relieved too!" And the same
  economics would apply." This clip comes from the episode titled "Reparations and
  Forgiving Student Debt." Watch the entire episode here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGWusrf6NC4&t=1084s
