type: video
description: 'The free market that I just described has never existed... In other
  words what markets do is distribute whatever is scarce to the people with the money.
  The most money wins. Well if the market is a game in which those with the most money
  win then it''s a game that favors the people with the most money. This is not rocket
  science, friends. The market is a system that favors the rich which is why the rich
  love markets." Watch the entire episode here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6W0723KubVA
