  Wolff goes beyond the simplistic, sterile Cold War debates of demonizers vs celebrants
  of the USSR as he delivers an in depth analysis of the USSR''s strengths, weaknesses,
  successes and failures from its revolutionary beginnings in 1917 to its implosion
  in 1989. The first episode of a special 2-part series where Professor Wolff gives
  the same in-depth analysis for the People''s Republic of China in the second part.
