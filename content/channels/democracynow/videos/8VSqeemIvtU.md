  Two Capitalist Parties
date: "2019-09-26T02:43:38+08:00"
type: video
description: 'You could see the whole modern identity politics being born in this
  onslaught to undo the New Deal. And what did the Democratic Party do? Did it go
  to their roots and say "No, we''re gonna be the united working class." No... So
  a new generation of Democrats led by people like Bill Clinton emerged, who said
  "Ok, if we can''t hold on to the working-class maybe we can keep our party going
  by appealing to the capitalists. If the Republicans split the working class and
  hurt us, we''ll split the capitalist class" Watch the entire episode here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XODoZEq_-GU&t=871s
