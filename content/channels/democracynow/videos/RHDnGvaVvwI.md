  For this episode of Left Out we sat down with Christian Parenti to discuss climate
  change and our current political landscape. Parenti is a sociologist trained at
  the London School of Economics and is currently an economics professor at John Jay
  College (CUNY). In our interview, we were able to ask Christian what it was like
  to straddle the realm between academia and journalism; prospects of climate catastrophe;
  climate change and justice; and the role of both politics and the state in any real
  solutions for a way forward. Links to Christian Parenti''s recent work: Tropic of
  Chaos: Climate Change and The New Geography of Violence Anthropocene or Capitalocene?:
  Nature, History, and the Crisis of Capitalism'
