  undemocratic, how pharmaceutical corporations work to block cheaper drug imports,
  why corporations in the U.S. do not need or deserve tax cuts, how Monsanto bought
  academic research to keep its dangerous "Roundup" product on the market, and the
  politics and economics of scapegoating immigrants in the US and Germany. The second
  half of this week’s episode features an interview with Joerg Rieger and Rosemarie
  Henkel-Rieger as they discuss how they combine faith and labor advocation to undo
  inequality in the US. The second half of this week''s episode is available via Patreon:
