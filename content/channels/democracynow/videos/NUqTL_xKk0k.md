  then, let me tell you, in the 1930s it went the other way. It was the capitalists
  who had brought us the Great Depression it was their bad investments, their corruption,
  their banking irregularities that had plunged us into this morass of 11-12 years
  of depression. They weren''t heroes. They were crooks. There were exploiters. They
  were the Robber Barons. But the last 40 years has converted them into "creative
  job-creating entrepreneurs." Nice change of language that reflects the purge of
  those who were critical." Support the show! Become an EU patron on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/economicupdate
