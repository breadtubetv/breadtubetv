description: This special feature is produced by Democracy at Work for Worker Independent
  News (WIN). This is Richard Wolff from Democracy at Work. I know that many folks
  have been paying attention to the rather heroic efforts of retail and restaurant
  workers across America trying to get fifteen dollars an hour. It’s is hardly good
  pay and it is hardly anything close to getting the American dream but, it is a great
  deal better than anything those workers have been getting. It is a noble cause it
  is being fought in a noble way. But it also has enemies and I want to talk about
  those enemies and draw a certain comparison. It’s mainly the leadership in the restaurant
  and retail industry that are pushing back. They don’t want, corporations don’t,
  to pay higher wages because they fear it will eat into their profits. Oh well they
  don’t say that, they talk about being concerned that they may have to lay off some
  workers if the actually had to pay them fifteen dollars and hour but, their concern
  for poor workers is hard to take seriously unless you really haven’t been paying
  much attention. So we know they are fighting back because they don’t want to give
  up profits. But lets take a look at the people who run the restaurant and retail
  industries in America. They are not little mom and pop outfits, not anymore, they
  have all been consolidated. I want to talk about a bunch of them that are famous
  to you. CVS the huge drugstore pharmaceutical company; L Brands, which you do not
  know under that name probably but you know as Victoria’s Secret; Starbucks, well
  I don’t need to explain that; and Walmart. Let’s take a look at those four because
  their CEOs, their chief executives, all have something in common; they all make
  a lot of money. And very interestingly USA Today recently calculated how much they
  get per hour, the heads of CVS, Victoria’s Secret, Starbucks and Walmart. And here
  is an interesting fact for you to think about, all of them earn more than $9,000
  an hour. But they don’t want to pay $15.00 an hour.
