  it happened and in the service of what it happened. It''s important to balance the
  criticisms of what they did, the price they paid, with what it was for. And therefore
  it''s important for me to stress to you that the achievement across the 20th century
  (from 1917 when the revolution happens to 1975, a crucial year in Russia), was an
  achievement of economic growth that had never been equalled by such a large economy
  in such a short historical time." Watch entire episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Y-TWFKw4tU&t=135s
