  the economics behind the great US anti-leftist purge (“McCarthyism”) after 1945.
  It then shows the economic impacts of that purge over the last half century. Finally,
  it explains how that history produced a very different political response to the
  crash of 2008 compared to FDR’s response to 1929. To watch the full episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2NNxyxc2Ao&t=877s
