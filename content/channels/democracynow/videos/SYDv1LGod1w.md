title: Richard Wolff on Tax Reform
date: "2019-09-26T02:44:20+08:00"
type: video
description: 'So Ocasio-Cortez was right more than she said. Tax reform can and should
  be done across the board, wherever taxes are unfair [and] discriminatory, because
  they''re always unfair and discriminatory in one particular way: the more you have,
  the more the tax system has been manipulated and changed over several decades (at
  least since the Second World War) to favor those at the top at the expense of everybody
  else." Watch entire episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e3Zakd6xJs&list=PLPJpiw1WYdTMLIyASxEheOVjl1vKkajYj&index=29&t=0s
