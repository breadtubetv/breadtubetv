description: May 1st is recognized as the international day of labor. Over 50 countries
  recognize the day as an official holiday while dozens of others mark the day with
  large marches and protests. Yet, the nation in which it all began, the United States,
  does not recognize May 1st as a day for workers, instead the day is curiously observed
  as "Law Day". In this episode we interviewed Jonah Walters, a writer for Jacobin
  Magazine who recently published a piece on May Day, to explore the origins of May
  Day as well as the the peculiar history and specific struggles that made this day
  the day of international labor.
