description: This is special feature is produced by Democracy at Work for Workers
  Independent News. This is Richard Wolff for Democracy at Work. The Consumer Product
  Safety Commission, that a body is Washington, is about to announce that it is going
  to be doing a number of things that are supposed to help us as consumers. One of
  them is to be a little more careful in identifying bad products, products that need
  to be recalled because they endanger our health or our safety. They are now happening
  at about one a day. They cover everything from food and medicine to automobiles
  and clothing, pretty much everything. Turns out that the corporations that produce
  these things are, I’ll be polite now, less than as careful as they might be to not
  sell us something that may be profitable for them but very bad for us. And as this
  process goes forward there is more and more attention because there are all these
  recalls. And one story that is being told is a story that I want to argue against.
  The story is, ‘well this is just human mistakes, they happen, everything can go
  wrong somewhere , these are honest mistakes and when the recall is announced by
  the government the companies generally agree and recall the product’. That is a
  very nice story but, it is often not true and that is what I want to get at. We
  have enormous examples, from the cigarettes that we now know are cancer producing
  and the cigarette companies knew it years before the recalls were demanded and the
  end of cigarette production was required, at least to a large extent. We recently
  had example of the automobile companies who knew years ago that either seatbelts
  were not adequate or ignition systems were not safe or pollution control elements
  were faulty. Yes, there are human mistakes but there are also decisions made by
  corporations, seeking to make money, that are holding back safety. That has to be
  faced. It is not just about a recall, it is about a system that puts profits ahead
  of people’s needs. This is Richard Wolff for Democracy at Work, and a special project
  for Workers Independent News.
