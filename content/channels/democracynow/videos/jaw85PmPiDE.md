description: On this week's Moyers & Company, economist Richard Wolff joins Bill to
  shine light on the disaster left behind in capitalism's wake, and discusses how
  to battle for economic justice. A noted professor emeritus at the University of
  Massachusetts at Amherst, and now visiting professor at Manhattan's New School,
  Wolff has written many books on the effects of rampant capitalism, including Capitalism
  Hits the Fan. "Capitalism has a long-term tendency to polarize wealth and income,"
  Wolff tells Bill.
