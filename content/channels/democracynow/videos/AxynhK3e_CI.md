  team! [S1 E16] What''s Happening to American Men - Part 1 American men are in serious
  trouble. Former standards of masculinity as aggression, power, and stoic denial
  of emotional vulnerability are now widely considered toxic. The economic dominance
  that white men had with family wages disappeared when American capitalists mechanized,
  computerized, and outsourced white men''s jobs from the 1970s on. Manhood has changed
  its demands. American women had a movement behind us when we changed our roles and
  poured into the labor force . Men do not have that powerful group support. Is it
  any wonder that all of America''s far too frequent mass shootings are perpetrated
  by men? I hope this pod cast helps us understand men''s confusion and suffering
  and helps to transform it into new human possibilities. Follow us ONLINE: Websites:
