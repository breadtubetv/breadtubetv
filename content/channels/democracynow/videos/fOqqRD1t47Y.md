description: '[S9 E28] Socialism & Worker Co-Ops 20th century socialism is now behind
  us. Socialists continued to evaluate both its achievements and failures via extensive
  self-criticism. A changed socialism has emerged, focused on a transition of workplaces
  from top-down hierarchical capitalist structures into democratic worker cooperatives.
  The powerful appeal of worker co-ops as grounding a new 21st century socialism is
  presented. We make it a point to provide the show free of ads. Please consider supporting
