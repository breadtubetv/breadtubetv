date: "2019-09-26T02:43:58+08:00"
type: video
description: 'If you don''t cherry-pick the statistics that make things look good
  and carefully avoid looking at those that don''t, if you don''t do that kind of
  lopsided behavior, you get much closer to the IMF''s assessment than to Mr. Trump''s
  self-serving effort at re-election next year." Watch entire episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2oDSEbiAZE&t=1093s
