  - Part 2 Thank you for supporting Capitalism Hits Home on Patreon! Your support
  helps us compensate the staff and additional workers it takes to put an episode
  together. Thank you for being a part of the CHH team! The US has had a class revolution
  in the household over the last 50 years and the left did not notice, no less champion
  that revolution. Hot button issues like abortion and birth control rights or family
  leave are shadow battles in that revolution. It is time to pay attention. Follow
