description: 'Democracy At Work has commissioned a participatory art piece by a New
  York arts collective, Animus. The piece is called "500 pieces" and has been created
  and re-created by guests at Professor Richard Wolff''s book launch events in California
  and New York. Each guest will receive a piece of wood with a notch in each side
  which they can place where ever they would like to create the artwork. Spectators
  became participants, taking a few pieces and connecting them to the structure. In
  doing do, they are being presented with different levels of creative control - collaborative
  and individual. Individually they will be given markers to decorate the notched
  squares. Collaboratively they will work together to assemble a single sculpture
  from those same notched squares. The artist, David Ort, will be on hand to guide
  people in building the piece. The piece will be created by guests a third time in
  New York at Richard Wolff''s book launch for Democracy at Work: A Cure for Capitalism
  at the Brecht Forum on October 9th. "The concepts and themes explored in the work:
  community and collaboration, decision and action." - David Ort'
