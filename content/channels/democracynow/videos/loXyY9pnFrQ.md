  had graduate [degrees], that is they not only got a BA degree but got some graduate
  training, and their wages only went up 0.6%... That is an awful record of the last
  20 years, roughly, of wages in America. They''re stagnant. And over the same period
  the productivity of all those workers went up... If what the employer gave you is
  stagnant, hasn''t gone anywhere in 18 years but the productivity has gone up what
  you''re doing is giving more and more to the employer and getting nothing extra
  for yourself." Watch entire episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH6S4... Follow
