  or inheritance, and those words are synonymous here, the whole idea was the notion,
  which some people used to think was "American" in some particular way, the notion
  of equal opportunity. So we don''t have estate tax that really bites and we have
  an exemption that means the child of wealthy people can walk away with that many,
  with $22 million free and clear. You know what this does? It cements into our culture
  the gap between rich and poor." Watch entire episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH6S4of5hJ8
