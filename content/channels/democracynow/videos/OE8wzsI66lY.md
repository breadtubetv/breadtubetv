date: "2019-09-26T02:44:11+08:00"
type: video
description: '... many companies become fewer companies until they''re just big enough
  and few enough to be able to get together at the golf course, play a few rounds
  and cut a few deals in order not to have to drop the prices, even after they''ve
  cut the costs. That''s what typically happens and that''s what mergers are all about."
