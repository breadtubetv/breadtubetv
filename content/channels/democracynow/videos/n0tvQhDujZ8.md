type: video
description: 'I wanted to do a brief, bold, and highly incomplete survey of what Marxism
  has done already in the way of shaping modern culture, influencing modern ways of
  thought. It’s a much more pervasive and deeply ingrained way of thinking than many
  people recognize, and to that end I want to do this brief survey. Some of the names
  I''m going to mention to you are known very well, others are almost unknown. It''s
  the breadth, the depth, the range of people whose work is influenced by Marxism
  that I want to underscore." Watch entire episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENn8sQ6eFek&list=PLPJpiw1WYdTMLIyASxEheOVjl1vKkajYj&index=9
