  week''s show Prof. Wolff presents an in-depth analysis of UBI shows its advantages
  over most welfare, safety net systems. An even better alternative would avoid capitalism''s
  unnecessary production of unemployment because it utilizes technical progress (rising
  productivity) for profits. The alternative benefits workers'' leisure rather than
  profits. It is more democratic and avoids splitting people into unemployed vs employed,
  non-poor vs poor population. Follow us ONLINE: Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/economicupdate
