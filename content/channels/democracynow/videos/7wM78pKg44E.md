  a profit. If they do, whatever their profit is goes back into the state governments
  income because it''s part of the state, and that means the state government doesn''t
  have to raise taxes as much as it otherwise would. That''s made the Bank of North
  Dakota quite popular. And if it doesn''t make profits it''s because it can offer
  loans on the basis of lower costs then a private bank would charge, which is good
  for all the borrowers who are the majority, not the lenders, who are the minority.
