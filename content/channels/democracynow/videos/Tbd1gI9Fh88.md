  Dallavalle, creates in-depth conversations with the most interesting political thinkers,
  heterodox economists, and organizers on the Left. In this episode, we speak with
  David Harvey about his latest book, MARX, CAPITAL, AND THE MADNESS OF ECONOMIC REASON,
  as well as what the Left most focus on to effectively organize for a better economy
  and society. CONTRIBUTING.md LICENSE README.md archetypes config.toml content data

  netlify.toml public resources scripts static David Harvey is arguably the most influential
  living geographer, as well as one of the world’s leading Marxist scholars. He is
  among the most cited intellectuals of all time across the humanities and social
  sciences. Harvey currently works as distinguished professor of anthropology and
  geography at CUNY, where he has been teaching Marx’s “Capital: Critique of Political
  Economy” for more than four decades. His course on Marx’s Capital has been downloaded
  by over two million people internationally since appearing online in 2008. Harvey
  is also a famous author of several bestselling books, including The Enigma of Capital,
  A Brief History of Neoliberalism, 17 Contradictions and the End of Capitalism, and
  many more. His latest book, Marx, Capital and the Madness of Economic Reason (out
  today), makes the core of Karl Marx’s thinking in the three volumes of Capital clear
  and accessible for the lay reader, without compromising their depth and complexity.
  Marx''s trilogy concerns the circulation of capital: volume I, how labour increases
  the value of capital, which he called valorisation; volume II, on the realisation
  of this value, by selling it and turning it into money or credit; and volume III,
  on what happens to the value next in processes of distribution. As Harvey argues
  in our interview, most people who read Capital often stop after the 1,152 pages
  of Volume I, which is very problematic if you want to understand the workings of
  capital as a totality. We ask Harvey why understanding all three volumes of Capital
  is so crucial, and why technological, economic and industrial change over the last
  150 years makes Marx’s analysis more relevant now than ever. In the last half of
  the discussion, we probe into whether it’s necessary for social movements today
  to develop a stronger institutional basis for understanding how capital and capitalism
  works, and ask Harvey what the Left most focus on to effectively organize for a
  better economy and society.'
