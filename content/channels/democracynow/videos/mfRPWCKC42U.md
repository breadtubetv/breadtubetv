  E13] Sexual Assault In the full episode, Dr. Fraad explores sexual harassment and
  sex abuse, particularly in the US. Sexual assaults have been a perk of male power
  seemingly forever. This podcasts asks why sexual abuse has been a perk of male power
  and why women are are daring to call it out now. Dr. Fraad looks at the issue through
  a Marxian lens which clarifies so much about why: why is it everywhere and why is
  it now confronted and condemned? Follow us ONLINE: Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/capitalismhitshome
