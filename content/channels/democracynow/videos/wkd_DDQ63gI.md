  the kind of power that you gave in Russia and China, and if you give them the kind
  of power in Scandinavia and elsewhere to regulate, you create tensions. In the communist
  world the tension was the government had so much power the danger was it would use
  it for political ends that were not socialist. And that indeed often happened. In
  Scandinavian type social democracies the government''s attempt to regulate was undone
  by the pushback of the private capitalists who didn''t want their profits limited.
  And so over time there was a reaction in the communist countries against the political
  problems of a powerful state, and there was the undoing of social democracy by the
  resistance of capitalists." To watch the full episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fwXo6xH9NA&t=555s
