description: 'd@w''s Paul Sliker and Dante Dallavalle talk with author and economist
  Michael Hudson, one of the worldâ€™s six economists who accurately predicted the 2007-2008
  financial crisis. His new book, J is for Junk Economics, reveals how the mainstream
  economic vocabulary has been turned around in an Orwellian way to mean just the
  opposite of what words used to mean. Michael explains how the media and academia
  use well-crafted euphemisms to conceal how the economy really works, the economy
  under Obama vs. Trump, and what might be coming next. For more from d@w visit our
