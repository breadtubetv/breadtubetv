description: This is Richard Wolff for Democracy at Work with a special feature for
  Workers Independent News. On July 1st 2016, 14 US cities states and counties, plus
  the District of Columbia raised their minimum wage. They raised it from everthing
  from 10.50 and hour all the way up to 15.00 an hour. Some raises go into effect
  immediately others are stretched out over the next 2 or 3 years. They deserve our
  acknowledgement. They have responded, or that is, their leaderships have, to the
  demand of working people over the last several years for 15.00 an hour minimums
  so let me mention them to you. Two of them are states, Maryland and Oregon. One
  of them is capital of our country, Washington D.C. One of them is a county, Los
  Angeles county in California. And the other 11 are cities. They include Chicago,
  8 cities in California, and 2 in Kentucky. Congratulations, you have done something
  that should have been done long ago, you have made a decent income at least within
  reach of most of your people, you have maintained the promise that the United States
  makes to people of giving them something in the way of a job about which they can
  entertain the so called ‘American Dream’. But the congratulations for the few who
  have responded to the pressure from the below has to be matched by a criticism of
  those who haven’t, first and foremost the Federal Government. The minimum wage as
  the Federal level remains 7.25 an hour. It hasn’t changed since 2009, even though
  every year since then the cost of living has gone up, but in fact our leaders, conservative
  Republicans alongside conservative Democrats haven’t seen fit to take the minimum
  step of increasing the minimum wage at the Federal level just to keep up with the
  standard in living. It is an outrage to get 14,500 a year if you do 40 hours of
  work a week for 50 weeks at $7.25. It’s a scandal, it’s a shame it is long overdue
  for a change. This is Richard Wolff for Democracy at Work, and a special project
  for Workers Independent News.
