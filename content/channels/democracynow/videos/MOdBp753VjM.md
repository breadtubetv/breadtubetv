  In the second half of our monthly meetings, we bring in a guest speaker, and share
  their talk here as well. But if you''re in the Los Angeles area and would like to
  see our guest speakers live, go to: http://eepurl.com/cJW7dX to sign up for our
  mailing list, or go to our website (www.democracyatwork-la.com) to learn more and
  get updates on our meetings and future speakers. At this meeting, we heard from
  two organizers from #DivestLA, a part of Revolution LA. "Divest LA is a movement
  for revolutionary action at the local level. Our aim is to use our civic power to
  embolden Los Angeles city officials and residents to reinvest our money towards
  socially and environmentally conscious institutions." Trinity Tran founded Revolution
  LA in 2014, the grassroots progressive organization that became the catalyst for
  Divest LA and Public Bank LA. In February 2016, Trinity created the Divest LA organization
  to mobilize activists behind the campaign to move the City of Los Angelesâ€™ public
  funds from Wells Fargo Bank into ethical financial institutions. In June 2016, Trinity
  co-founded the Public Bank LA campaign to create a new epoch of finance through
  a socially and environmentally chartered municipal public bank. She believes Revolution
  is not about destruction, but creation and transformation. She enjoys maneuvering
  moving parts to solve complex problems. Phoenix Goodman is a co-founder of Revolution
  LA, a grassroots organization aimed at fundamentally transforming our political
  and economic system with a people and planet based agenda. Through Revolution LA,
  Goodman co-founded #DivestLA - a campaign that was successful in having the City
  of Los Angeles partly divest from Wells Fargo Bank due to the bank''s unethical
  business practices. Most recently, #DivestLA has been involved with the initiative
  Public Bank LA, in order to develop the nation''s first Municipal Public Bank. The
  institution would provide ethical and sustainable financial services for the city.
  Goodman develops policy recommendations for #DivestLA and Public Bank LA.'
