  Delegate Lee Carter serves Virginia’s 50th House of Delegate district, which includes
  the City of Manassas and western Prince William County. He was inspired to run after
  being hurt on the job and subsequently failed by Virginia’s worker compensation
  system. Delegates Carter won in 2017 on a platform of expanding worker protections
  and ending corruption of the General Assembly by the hands of large corporations.
