  This week on Economic Update, Professor Wolff explores the historic parallels of
  the U.S. working class and politics in the U.S. He begins by exploring how and why
  the Great Depression of the 30’s married the U.S. working class to FDR''s Democratic
  Party and then explains how that led to both the Democratic and Republican parties
  becoming pro-capitalist - which has led to both parties presiding over the exponential
  growth of income and wealth inequalities along with the political power the richest
  10% have, and exploit, over the working class in the U.S. today. Professor Wolff
  goes on to show that because of this, Trump landing in the White House was a result
  of the working class’ disgust with both parties. Professor Wolff ends with a discussion
  about the implications of this history for the upcoming 2020 election. Read the
