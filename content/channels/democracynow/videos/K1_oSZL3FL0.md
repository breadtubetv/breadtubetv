  resources to have a nuclear military, the resources to invade other countries and
  manage them at a distance etc. And it turned out the Russians couldn''t do all they
  set out to do. They couldn''t create a consumer industry big enough, they couldn''t
  create an economy rich enough to support an arms race with the richest country on
  earth. They couldn''t do it. But they kept trying and as they tried and people''s
  anger, add to that the absence of civil liberties, the absence of civil rights,
  looking to the West as a place where these things they could not have in Russia
  were had, they became critical of very defensive. Yes it had produced the miracle
  of economic power and growth but the Communist Party, as a party that wasn''t doing
  enough. And the party became very defensive. Yes, it had produced the miracle of
  economic power and growth but they had paid that big price." Watch entire episode:
