  to put the ''Eco'' prefix out there because socialism implies that you make decisions

  interests of people without taking into account the environment. However, because
  of the historical evolution of the awareness of these different dimensions the ''Eco''
  has to be added on for purposes really of emphasis." Support the show! Become an
