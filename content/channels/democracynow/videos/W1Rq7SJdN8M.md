description: 'In the second half of our monthly meetings, we bring in a guest speaker,
  and share their talk here as well. But if you''re in the Los Angeles area and would
  like to see our guest speakers live, go to: http://eepurl.com/cJW7dX to sign up
  for our mailing list, or go to our website (www.democracyatwork-la.com) to learn
  more and get updates on our meetings and future speakers. Gilda Haas is an organizer,
  popular educator, and urban planner who has been helping grassroots organizations
  build economic projects and institutions from the ground up for the past thirty-five
  years. Gilda taught community economic development at UCLA’s Department of Urban
  Planning for about 30 years, where she also co-founded the Community Scholars Program.
  Gilda was the founding Executive Director of Strategic Actions for a Just Economy,
  a co-founder of the national Right to the City Alliance, and has developed business
  plans for democratic enterprises such as a credit union and land trust. Gilda presently
  works as a member of the L.A. Coop Lab collective; as her alter-ego, Dr. Pop; as
  a consultant to The California Endowment on matters related to gentrification and
  displacement; and as a local loan officer with The Working World. At Democracy at
  Work - Los Angeles (d@w-LA), we endeavor to further our parent organization’s purpose,
  that is, raising awareness and generating a positive cultural shift towards Worker
  Self-Directed Enterprises. WSDEs are a way to reorganize our workplaces in a truly
  democratic fashion, where decision-making power and wealth are shared equally. Through
  promotion, education, and connection with local organizations, we aim to be a hub
  in Los Angeles that advocates for and facilitates the transformation of our economic
  system. “We can, and we must, do better than capitalism.” - Prof. Richard Wolff
