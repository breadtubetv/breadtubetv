  Past to Future On this episode of Economic Update, Prof. Wolff begins with an overview
  of socialism''s history, especially in the U.S. where it was widely discussed up
  to 1945, then repressed in the Cold War and now vigorously revived since the crash
  of 2008. He then examines socialism''s basic economic criticism of capitalism in
  the 20th century. In the second half of the show, Prof. Wolff goes on to show how
  and why socialism, as it is re-emerging now, is new and different. Follow us ONLINE:
