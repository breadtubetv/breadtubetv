  most of human existence, human societies were hunter gatherer societies. We survived
  through our ability to cooperate. That changed with the evolution of private property
  which was left to heirs. Controlling women was an opportunity to ensure that only
  a man’s heirs could inherit his property. Just as early matriarchal religions provided
  the ideology of sharing and worship of women’s sexuality, patriarchal religions
  like Judaism, Christianity and Islam created religious ideology that endorsed a
  male God and male supremacy. Follow us ONLINE: Websites: https://www.democracyatwork.info/capitalismhitshome
