  broader progressive workers union at this point, unionizing organizations like the
  Sierra Club and building our collective voice and action around not just workers
  rights but economic justice, social justice, racial justice issues is really about
  making progressive organizations practice what they preach and therefore strengthening
  movements from within." Neha Mathew-Shah is President of Progressive Workers Union
  (PWU) and currently employed with the Sierra Club as an International Environmental
  Justice Representative. As a non-profit employee for over seven years, Neha has
  experienced the power of working with a union to build a powerful, equitable and
  inclusive environment both inside and outside the workspace. At Sierra Club, this
  change has been driven by two unions that represent the two-thirds of the organizations
  employees, PWU and Sierra Employee Alliance (SEA). Watch entire episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3n-sQTG_XI&t=1578s
