  talks about the re-emergence of the Womenâ€™s Movement. Unlike the 1960s and 1970s,
  the need for basic economic change applies to both men and women together rather
  than women versus men, one gender versus the other. The American economic boat is
  sinking: men and women are drowning together. Only a movement unified around class
  differences and addressing all issues together will have a chance to win the lasting
  change we need. Follow us ONLINE: Websites: https://www.democracyatwork.info/capitalismhitshome
