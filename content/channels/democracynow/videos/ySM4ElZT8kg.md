  States is lower today than it was in 1973 and that is something to think about.
  But now comes the Chinese story. Over the same period of time, the last 20-25 years,
  real wages in the People''s Republic of China have quadrupled." Watch the full episode

  Record and Strategy This week on Economic Update, Professor Wolff follows up with
  part two of his in-depth analyses of the USSR and anti-capitalist governments by
  providing (1) an overview of China''s economic development mostly over the last
  25 years (GDP, real wages, etc.), and (2) its economic strategy: learning but also
  differing from Soviet strategy along with some relevant, and interesting, historical
  context. We make it a point to provide the show free of ads. Please consider supporting
