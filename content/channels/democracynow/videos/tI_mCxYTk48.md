  Hello this is Richard Wolff from Democracy at Work. Hello. I want to tell you a
  story briefly of the Chobani Corporation, a company with 2000 employees that makes
  Greek style yogurt. It has been very successful over recent years and is now a company
  worth between 3 and 5 billion dollars. But what is important about that is not how
  successful the company has been but how it relates between the workers on the one
  hand and the leader ship, the CEO the owners of the business, on the other. The
  Owner is Hamdi Ulukayaa man of Turkish background who runs the company and who did
  something remarkable this last week. He decided that the success of his company
  was as much do to the workers as anything else and that therefore he should share
  a specific amount of profits with them. And he did so. He dished out a big share
  of profits with his 2000 workers. The average share given to the workers was worth
  $150,000. You heard me right. If you have been with the company longer than that
  you could earn as much as a share worth one million dollars. The workers were ecstatic.
  But I don’t want to focus on the good luck they had. I want to focus on the reasoning
  of the employer Mr. Ulukaya. He said, ‘this company will do much better now that
  I have given workers shares in the company, shares that are worth a lot, shares
  that will make them and the company stronger and better off’. What an interesting
  idea. Now let’s take it a step further. Suppose businesses everywhere were owned
  and operated by the workers together in them, that they were worker coops. You know
  what the logic of Mr Ulukaya says? Those worker coops would work even better, do
  more for the community, earn more money, have more profits and distribute them more
  to their own workers. What a though, what an understanding.
