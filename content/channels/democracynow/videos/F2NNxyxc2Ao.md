  Great American Purge This week’s episode of Economic Update is a little different
  from the usual program. Professor Wolff begins by explaining the economics behind
  the great U.S. anti-leftist purge (“McCarthyism”) after 1945. It then shows the
  economic impacts of that purge over the last half century. In the second half, Prof.
  Wolff explains how that history produced a very different political response to
  the crash of 2008 compared to FDR’s response in 1929. Read a transcript of this
