  Howard J. Sherman is Professor Emeritus of Economics, UC Riverside, and Visiting
  Researcher at UCLA Department of Political Sciences. He is also an activist radical.
  During the McCarthy period of repression in the 1950s, he was tossed out of the
  U.S. Army and fought for 8 years to win an honorable status and his GI Bill rights.
  Since that time, he has fought with the pen, writing over 20 books and over 100
  articles, all of them using the paradigm of radical economics.'
