  Victor Grossman, born Stephen Wechsler, a New York red-diaper baby of the 1930s,
  joined the Communist Party as a Harvard student. Fleeing the U.S. Army during the
  McCarthy Era, he swam the Danube River to the Soviet Zone of Austria and was sent
  to East Germany. There, he studied journalism and became a freelance writer and
  popular speaker. He was pardoned by the U.S. Army in 1994 and, in 2003, published
  an autobiography, Crossing the River: A Memoir of the American Left, the Cold War,
  and Life in East Germany ((U. of Mass.Press). Victor Grossman will be visiting Washington,
