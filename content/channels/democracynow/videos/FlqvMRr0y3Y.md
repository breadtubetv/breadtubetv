  we sat down with Christian Parenti to discuss climate change and our current political
  landscape. Parenti is a sociologist trained at the London School of Economics and
  is currently an economics professor at John Jay College (CUNY). He’s written extensively
  on the connection between climate change and geopolitical conflict around the globe
  and has reported from war zones in Afghanistan, Iraq, as well as parts of Africa,
  Latin America, and Asia. His writing has appeared in Fortune, The Washington Post, The
  New York Times, Middle East Report, London Review of Books, Mother Jones, and The
  Nation (where he is Contributing Editor). In 2011 he authored the book, Tropic of
  Chaos: Climate Change and The New Geography of Violence , which explored how climate
  change is already causing violence as it interacts with the legacies of economic
  neoliberalism and cold-war militarism. His latest piece of work is featured in Anthropocene
  or Capitalocene?: Nature, History, and the Crisis of Capitalism, alongside a collection
  of provocative essays on nature and power, humanity, and capitalism framed within
  a politics of hope that signal the possibilities for transcending capitalism. In
  our interview, we were able to ask Christian what it was like to straddle the realm
  between academia and journalism; prospects of climate catastrophe; climate change
  and climate justice; and the role of both politics and the state in any real solutions
  for a way forward. CONTRIBUTING.md LICENSE README.md archetypes config.toml content
