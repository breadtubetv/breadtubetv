  can do better. History hasn''t stopped with capitalism. If capitalism was an improvement
  (which Marxist generally believe) over the slavery and the feudalism that existed
  beforehand it also can be improved upon and nobody should be allowed to shut down
  the conversation that Marxists insist on; that we can, we should, we need to do
  better." We make it a point to provide the show free of ads. Please consider supporting
