title: Richard Wolff on a Conservative Argument Against Free Education
date: "2019-09-26T02:44:01+08:00"
type: video
description: 'So you see, we shouldn''t give them loans and we certainly shouldn''t
  free the tuition because colleges will raise their tuition and employers will stop
  raising wages. Oh my goodness. This is why we shouldn''t help people because others
  in this crazy system would take advantage of helping people. That''s right. That''s
  their argument." Watch the entire episode here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_gLw2Y_Oys&t=1285s
