  have given a lifetime of work to our society that a pension serves, it''s also the
  children of those people because if there isn''t a pension for the older ones they
  really have nowhere else to turn but to their children. So it becomes then an economic
  concern for the entire family, not just the older folks, everybody who''s connected
  to them." Due to the working holiday, there is not a new episode this week. Instead,
  we will be taking a look back. This clip comes from the episode "Renewing Labors
  Movement" which was published here on our Youtube channel on March 10, 2019. Watch
