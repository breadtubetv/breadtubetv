  tacit acceptance of what is and ask the question ''What do we want this to be? What
  could the world be?'' And I do think worker co-ops are a step in that direction."
  Matthias Scheiblehner is a longtime carpenter, builder, and student of history from
  the Seattle area. He founded Mētis Construction Inc. in 2008. In early 2016, he
  and 17 coworkers completed the process of restructuring Mētis as a worker controlled,
  trust held cooperative. Follow us ONLINE: Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/economicupdate
