  like this one! A patron asks: "You should dedicate a segment to analyzing the structure
  of a corporation as a totalitarian institution. Every corporation can be conceived
  of as a centrally-managed command economy (a Soviet Union unto itself, so to speak)
  where orders come from the top, are handed down by managers, and are carried out
  by a hive of dronish order-takers. The global economy can be conceived of as a network
  of command economies, not "trading" or "competing" with one another in any meaningful
  sense, but forming collusive "trilateral blocs" of coopetition and oligopolistic
  "strategic alliances." It puts the lie to the view commonly advanced by Austrian
  schoolers and "libertarians" about the impracticality of central planning. Walmart
  is the largest centrally-planned institution in the world. There''s a superb book
  about this called The People''s Republic of Walmart." Follow Wolff ONLINE: Web:
