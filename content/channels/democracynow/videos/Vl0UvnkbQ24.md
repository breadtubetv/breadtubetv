  at 3 main kinds of socialism and how they affect the mass of people. In this clip
  he addresses the third, democratizing the workplace. "I think the idea of this third
  socialism is to achieve something in your daily life that the other two socialisms
  never did. That when the first kind had the government regulation or the second
  kind (the communist kind) had the government take over, the transformation of the
  workplace never happened. You were still the worker who comes and does what he or
  she is told for the 8 hours and then goes home. This is a new world, this third
  kind of socialism." Watch entire episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7x7oVwhHok&t=929s
