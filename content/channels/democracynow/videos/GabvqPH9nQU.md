  and look toward socialist alternatives, it is important to grasp key differences
  among the alternative kinds of socialism. This program explains those differences

  kind of socialism (in the USSR and People''s Republic of China, and (3) the new

  of them) will be the better economic structure. Watch entire episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7x7oVwhHok&t=929s
