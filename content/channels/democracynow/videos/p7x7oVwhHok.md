  Socialism This week on Economic Update, Professor Wolff discusses the three basic
  kinds of socialism as anti-capitalist ideologies grow in the U.S. and more people
  are looking toward socialist alternatives. Prof. Wolff lays out the importance of
  grasping key differences among the alternative kinds of socialism. The first half
  of the show is an examination of those differences among (1) the moderate or "democratic"
  socialism ( a la Scandinavia), (2) the communist kind of socialism (in the USSR
  andÂ People''s Republic of China) and (3) the new socialism focused on democratizing
  the work place. The second half of the show focuses on how doing better than capitalism
  will require deciding which of these three kinds of "socialism" (or what combination
  of them) will be a better economic structure for the masses. Read the transcript
