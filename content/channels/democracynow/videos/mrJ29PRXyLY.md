  The first half of this week’s episode of Economic Update features a discussion by
  Professor Wolff on the parallels of declining capitalism in the UK and the U.S.
  and how the denials of the systemic problems inherent with capitalism are making
  the economic situations in both countries profoundly worse. In the second half of
  this week’s show, Professor Wolff presents two longer segments on (1) the political
  economy of immigration, and (2) why the basic problem of Central and South America
  is 2-3 centuries of capitalism producing and reproducing extreme inequality, staggering
  poverty, and corrupt government elites. That is the crucial context for the Cuban
  and Venezuelan efforts, however imperfect and against U.S. opposition, to break
  out of capitalism. Follow us ONLINE: Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/economicupdate
