description: This episode takes a critical look at the The Trans Pacific Partnership
  (TPP), a trade deal involving 12 countries, encompassing nearly 40% of the global
  economy. Though lauded by the U.S. government as a deal “ that will help increase
  Made-in-America exports, grow the American economy, support well-paying American
  jobs, and strengthen the American middle class”, a closer look demonstrates otherwise.
  Exploring the thousands of pages of text with economists, policy experts, and union
  leaders, we delve into investor state dispute settlements, the relationship between
  the TPP and regressive distribution of wealth, monopoly creation through patent
  protection and what this all means for the working class. Guests for this episode
  include Robert E. Scott of the Economic Policy Institute, Melinda St. Louis of Public
  Citizen’s Global Trade Watch, Wayne Ranick of the United Steelworkers Union and
  David Rosnick of the Center for Economic Policy and Research. You can link some
  of their work below. The Economic Policy Institute's Robert E. Scott maintains a
  blog full of technical information on the TPP and other trade deals. For a review
  of trade relations with China since 2001 read Robert E. Scott’s The China Toll .
  He also has a more recent position paper written to the United States International
  Trade Commision dealing with the TPP in particular Public Citizen has a great webpage
  of resources particular to the TPP their initial analysis of the TPP is eye opening
  The United Steel Workers covered the effects of the TPP on working families in a
  recent blog post David Rosnick of the Center for Economic and Policy Research published
  a report demonstrating how the median wage earner would lose income while top wage
  earners would gain from the TPP
