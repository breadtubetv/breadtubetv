  of the USSR''s strengths, weaknesses, successes and failures from its revolutionary
  beginnings in 1917 to its implosion in 1989. The first episode of a special 2-part
  series where Professor Wolff gives the same in-depth analysis for the People''s
  Republic of China in the second part. Read transcript on our website: https://www.democracyatwork.info/eu_rise_and_fall_of_the_ussr
