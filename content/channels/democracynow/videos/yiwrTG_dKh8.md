  --- In the second half of our monthly meetings, we bring in a guest speaker, and
  share their talk here as well. But if you''re in the Los Angeles area and would
  like to see our guest speakers live, go to: http://eepurl.com/cJW7dX to sign up
  for our mailing list, or go to our website (www.democracyatwork-la.com) to learn
  more and get updates on our meetings and future speakers. In April, we were joined
  by Niki Okuk and Bryan "Magnum" from RCO² Tires, a tire recycling / re-manufacturing
  factory in Compton. Niki, a graduate of economics from Columbia and MIT, returned
  to her hometown of LA to start RCO² Tires. Bryan, a formerly incarcerated artist,
  was brought on in the early stages of the business and is now the foreman. RCO²
  Tires as grown a lot in the last 4 years and also recently unionized. But it''s
  ultimate goal is to become a worker cooperative. This is a challenge for multiple
  reasons (practical and cultural) but one that they are determined to achieve. They
  came to d@w-Los Angeles to share their experiences, hopes, concerns and more. At
  Democracy at Work - Los Angeles (d@w-Los Angeles), we endeavor to further our parent
  organization’s purpose, that is, raising awareness and generating a positive cultural
  shift towards Worker Self-Directed Enterprises. WSDEs are a way to reorganize our
  workplaces in a truly democratic fashion, where decision-making power and wealth
  are shared equally. Through promotion, education, and connection with local organizations,
  we aim to be a hub in Los Angeles that advocates for and facilitates the transformation
  of our economic system. --- “We can, and we must, do better than capitalism.” -
