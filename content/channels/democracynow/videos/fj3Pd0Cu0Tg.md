  500 companies] pay no taxes but many of them claimed refunds, which they got. How
  much? $4.3 billion dollars of your taxes that you paid were sent back to these companies
  who paid no taxes at all during the same year. Total amount of money they earned
  on which they paid no taxes: $79 billion. Add to that $4.3 billion of refunds. This
  is a perverse tax code." Watch entire episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GERaWznNm4g&t=447s
