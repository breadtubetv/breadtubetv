type: video
description: 'If you look at how that how the system treats and Mr. Epstein versus
  Eric Garner, you really have in a nutshell how upside down our current moment is...
  And so you really have two tracks of justice here and it''s becoming really, at
  this point, medieval. I mean, the stark contrasts are getting worse every day."
