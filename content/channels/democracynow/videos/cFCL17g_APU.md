type: video
description: 'According to a report issued by Giving USA, an organization which tracks
  charitable giving, 2015 was a record breaking year with over $358 billion dollars
  being donated. In this episode of left out we explore the relationship between increased
  inequality and the rise of philanthropic giving. Close attention is paid to how
  philanthropic missions often ignore structural root causes and instead focus primarily
  on ''symptoms''. In this episode, we interview Professor Linsey McGoey Professor
  at the University of Essex who recently published a book, "No Such Thing as A Free
  Gift: The Gates Foundation and the Price of Philanthropy"on new trends in philanthropy,
  namely the giving of philanthropic dollars to corporate entities. We also speak
  with David Callahan, Editor of Inside Philanthropy to discuss philanthropy''s relationship
  to political and economic inequality with an emphasis on recent education efforts.
  Finally, we interview Frank Emspak, Executive Director of Diversified Media Enterprises,
  a Madison based media organization that produces news stories highlighting labor
  struggles. He reflects back on the growing presence of philanthropy in independent
  media outfits like his own over the past 30 years and what it means for organizing
  in the future. Our Website: http://www.democracyatwork.info/'
