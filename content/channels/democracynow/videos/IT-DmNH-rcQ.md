  do things and then you quickly find a billion dollars overnight! You said there
  was no money but you found it quickly and you found it for people who don''t need
  it, for people who are already crazy rich and who are gonna rip off this government
  and our society as they give money to get the publicity of being so charitable."

  be taking a look back. This clip comes from the episode "Social Movement for Economic
  Democracy" which was published here on our Youtube channel on May 12, 2019. Watch
