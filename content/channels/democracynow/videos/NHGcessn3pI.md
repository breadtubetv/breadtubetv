  In this episode, we sat down with Kali Akuno — the co-founder and co-directer of
  Cooperation Jackson. We discuss the emerging network of worker-owned cooperatives
  and the people behind it building an alternative, solidarity-based economy inside
  the majority-black and impoverished city of Jackson, Mississippi. In Jackson Rising,
  Akuno helps chronicle the history, present and future of one of the most dynamic
  yet under-documented experiments in radical social transformation taking place in
  the United States. The book follows the surprising story of the city’s newly elected
  Mayor, Choke Antara Lumumba, whose vision is to “encourage the development of cooperative
  businesses” and make Jackson the “most radical city on the planet.” In the first
  part of the interview, we ask Akuno about the ongoing organizing and institution
  building of the black, working-class political forces concentrated in Jackson dedicated
  to advancing the “Jackson-Kush Plan.” We then diver deeper into the different types
  of worker-owned cooperatives that makeup Cooperation Jackson; the importance of
  developing cooperatives with clear political aims; and the need for a nationwide
  network of cooperatives and solidarity economic institutions as a viable alternative
  to the exploitative nature of our current economic, social, and environmental relations.
  Cooperation Jackson is one of the most important stories for those of us struggling
  for social justice, for human emancipation and self-determination, and for a solidarity
  economics as a base for working class political struggle and the fight against the
  systematic economic strangulation. Pick up a copy of Jackson Rising: The Struggle
