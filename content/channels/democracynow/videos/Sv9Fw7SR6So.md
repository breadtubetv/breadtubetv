description: This is special feature is produced by Democracy at Work for Workers
  Independent News. This is Richard Wolff for Democracy at Work. You know the people
  who run the biggest corporations in the United States are fond of telling the rest
  of us that we ought to be happy that they control most of what happens in this economy.
  Because they know what they are doing, they are the big shots they have risen to
  the top and we are in good hands because the capitalists system they preside over
  delivers the goods. Well, I don’t believe it. And now we have evidence, if we ever
  needed it, of a stunning example of how this isn’t true. We are currently seeing
  the whole sale collapse of oil and gas companies across the United States. To be
  precise, 59 oil and gas companies are now bankrupt with this last week’s filings.
  The number of US energy bankruptcies is closing in on the staggering 68 filings
  that occurred in the telecom industry between 2002 and 2003. And we expect even
  more. We expect oil and gas to collapse even worse than the tech boom became the
  tech bubble back then. What went on? Oil companies decided they knew what was to
  be done and how to do it. They were going to invest in fracking, they were going
  to destroy parts of this country, pump chemicals into the ground, create earthquakes,
  but it would all pay off because they would get oil and gas and they would become
  billionaires and we would be the nation that would save the world….. A whole lot
  of BS. What they did was to forget that if the United States produced a lot more
  oil and the rest of the world doesn’t need a lot more oil the price of oil is going
  to collapse. Which is what it did, which is why they are going bankrupt, which is
  why banks are in trouble because they lent billions to them. Bankers, oil companies,
  they are not the ones to put our confidence in. They make colossal mistakes. We
  ought not to have confidence. We ought to see that a better economic system is what
  we need, sooner, not later.
