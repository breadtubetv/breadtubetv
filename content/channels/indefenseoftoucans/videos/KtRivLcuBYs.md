type: video
description: 'Welcome to hopefully what is a one off "response video" but I felt compelled
  to make a response to it. If you love this video or hate it let me know I might
  consider trying to find a way to fit in more off the cuff unscripted content like
  this. This was 3 hours to make unlike the 20-35 hours of effort the others take.
