description: 'People continue to think Leon Trotsky’s Permanent Revolution advocates
  for Military Adventurism as in for invading other countries. I think this is a product
  of people getting Trotsky’s role as the leader of the Red Army, mixed in with the
  incorrect narrative that the 1920s debates in the USSR being between Stalin’s Socialism
  in One Country Vs Trotsky’s Permanent Revolution. I some day hope to do a series
  of videos on what the arguments actually were about in the 1920s, but for now I
  wanted to make a quick video debunking the idea that Trotsky advocated for growing
  the revolution by Red Army As for all my videos my script can be downloaded with
  sources. I will also include a source list in the description to make it more transparent.
