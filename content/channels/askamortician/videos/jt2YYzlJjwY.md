  Foreskin Fun Fact! Austrian nun Agnes Blannbekin "led a life devoted to the foreskin
  of Jesus". The study says: "She was obsessed by the loss of blood and the pain which
  the redeemer had suffered during his circumcision. On one occasion, when she was
  moved to tears by the thought of this suffering, she suddenly felt the foreskin
  on her tongue." http://www.theguardian.com/education/2009/feb/17/circumcision-jesus-christ'
