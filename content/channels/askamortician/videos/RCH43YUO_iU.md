  all the emails you''ll need to start: http://ow.ly/YywJb Here is the Change.org
  petition: http://ow.ly/YywFs LATEST NEWS: The Virginia House Subcommittee on Health,
  Welfare and Institutions has been given SB595. Chairperson Richard Bell (R) and
  all four members of the subcommittee (Oâ€™Bannon (R), Orrock (R), Garrett (R) and
  James (D) have received another letter from the NHFA president. Our VA home funeral
  advocates are now making calls and writing to them as well. The petition floated
  by a Virginia citizen that got more than 700 signatures in a week has been sent
  to the subcommittee as well. The attorney we consulted agreed with all the steps
  taken. And the media has taken up the story, thanks to several active NHFA members.
