  Keep in mind, there''s NO WAY a 5 minute video can cover everything, it''s best
  to look up "Advance Directive-- then your state/country/province" for more detailed
  info. Some easy to understand steps: 1) designate the person you want to be your
  "agent" 2) have a conversation with them about your wishes and gain their consent
  to accept this role 3) I would suggest going here http://www.caringinfo.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=3289
  Then, click on your state and fill out the forms. OR You can also visit an attorney
  who specializes in ADs, living wills, etc. 4) Visit a notary with your agent (there
  are also mobile notaries if you need them to come to you) You will need to provide
  identification to the notary. Your state may also require up to two witnesses. It
  should state if this is required on the documents you downloaded from your state
  on the caringinfo.org site. An attorney can also inform you. 5) Store documents
  in a digital bank like Docubank, carry copies with you - some people suggest putting
  them into a freezer lock ziplock bag and putting them in the freezer and tell everyone
  that''s where they are. DO NOT put in a safe or safety deposit box. The "Put it
  in writing" brochure (here''s a link to the pdf) this addresses most common questions
  about advanced directives plus, a super useful glossary of medical terms for people
  who are looking for input and clarification on what things to they may need to consider
  http://www.aha.org/content/13/putitinwriting.pdf Docubank- great for everyone -
  you file all our advanced directives, will, power of attorney etc. digitally - it''s
  just like an online/digital safe. This service issues you a card you can carry in
  a wallet. In case of emergency, your designated person (or anyone really) or hospital
  staff can call number on the card and immediately be provided with all your legal
  documents - https://www.docubank.com "It is especially critical for gay, lesbian,
  bisexual and transgender people to know that if you do not create a health care
  proxy naming your partner or a friend as your agent, the hospitals and courts will
  look to your closest biological family member to make health care decisions for
  you, and your partner or friend will have no legal right to make such decisions.
  Also note that a health care proxy becomes ineffective at your death and it is,
  therefore, critical that you also have a will." http://www.hrc.org/resources/entry/health-care-proxy'
