  Casket has four sides, a top and bottom, (rectangular shaped.) - term mostly used
  in N. America. - A coffin has six sides, with a top and bottom, (hexagonal shaped)
  The word coffin comes from the Old French cofin and from the Latin cophinus, which
  translates into basket. The word was first used in the English language in 1380.
  A coffin is defined as a box or chest for the display/burying of a corpse. When
  used to transport the deceased, a coffin may also be referred to as a pall. - In
  1785 Joseph II introduced a bunch of burial regulations. Corpses were to be buried
  naked and sewn into a simple cloth shroud. The Emperor also wasn''t keen on wasting
  wood for coffins to the idea of a the so-called ‘economy coffin’, which could be
  used several times came about. It was made of wood and its lower side was fitted
  with a flap which could be opened to allow the body being buried to drop into the
  grave. However, the Viennese did not care much for this form of rationalization
  and protested. After just six months Joseph II had to withdraw the measure. Pic
  and details of burial reforms here: http://michaelorenz.blogspot.com/2013/07/mozart-and-myth-of-reusable-coffins.html
  - In the United States, the early casket industry evolved from local furniture and
  cabinet makers who were the logical choice for building caskets. They eventually
  took on other duties like hiring and driving hearses and this evolved into the job
  of undertaker. Caskets on an as-needed basis. During times of plague - diphtheria,
  flu, etc. many rural areas ran out of wood and would disassemble barns, carriages
  or other furniture to provide wood for a loved one''s coffin. During the Civil War,
  thousands of coffins were needed to transport dead soldiers, marking the start of
  the mass-produced casket era. - The Fisk Coffin: "In 1848, Almond Fisk patented
  a metal coffin he believed would revolutionize death. One problem: some people thought
  the burial case with its human contours was creepy as hell." http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/morbid-monday-fisk-mummy-case'
