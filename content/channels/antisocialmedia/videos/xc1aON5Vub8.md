  terrorism, but PJW looks a fool because he''s wrong about EVERYTHING. Twitter: https://twitter.com/ASM_AntiSocial
  Despite my best efforts, this video does contain a few seconds of copyrighted music,
  therefore YouTube refuses to monetise it. I''m gutted I can''t earn a whopping $3-$5
  dollars for 5 days worth of work. So if you liked the video feel free to send me
  a similar amount via paypal, or set up a monthly payment with Patreon. I AM SO VERY
  POOR. Donate $1 a month via PATREON: https://www.patreon.com/AntiSocialMedia Or
  a one-off $1 donation via PAYPAL: https://www.paypal.me/AntiSocialMedia My EDGE
