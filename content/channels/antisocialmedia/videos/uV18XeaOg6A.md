description: 'Milo Yiannopolous (@Nero) is one of a handful of very popular professional
  Trolls. He uses offensive comments and extreme views to gain attention (mostly negative)
  and to make a living. He is very successful at it, but that doesn''t mean he''s
  immune to a mocking on Youtube. This video is based around his ridiculous article
  ''10 Things I''d Do As Twitter CEO''. =========================================
