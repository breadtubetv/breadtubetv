type: video
description: 'Hillary Clinton mentioned them, and their mascot, Pepe the Frog is now
  officially a hate symbol, but what IS the Alt-Right, what do they do, and who do
  they hate? Update, May 2018 - This was a very early video by me, and it is still
  very funny and informative in places, however there are a few mistakes and glaring
  errors too. Please bear that in mind when watching, thanks. x ====================
