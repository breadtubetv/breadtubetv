  Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/AntiSocialMedia Subscribing and liking videos is
  great, but if you want to go one stage further you can give me a whopping $1.00
  a month via Patreon (that''s around Â£7 per year). I will invest in recording equipment
  (decent camera, editing programmes, pop-shield for the mic, etc) with your donations.
  I am not here to make a profit. I repeat: THIS IS A NON-PROFIT PATREON. Thanks for
  watching. x'
