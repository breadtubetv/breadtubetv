description: 'Right-Wingers Don''t Understand Comedy, part 1. In this new video series
  I explore the right and far-right''s inability to be funny, and misunderstand how
  comedy works. Part 1 is a response to Owen Benjamin''s video for the propaganda
  network ''Prager U''. His video is called ''The Strange Death Of Comedy''. Needless
  to say - Comedy is alive and well. ===== ANTI-SOCIAL MEDIA on Twitter: https://twitter.com/ASM_AntiSocial
