  Nobody cares about Chapo, Cum Town and Red Scare - except YOU. But why? What are
  the accusations against these pods? Are there really fascists infiltrating the left?
  And is my own podcast acceptable PRAXIS? This is a DISCUSSION EPISODE, your feedback
  is required. Ideally leave a comment on youtube, and join in the debate. x === Throw
