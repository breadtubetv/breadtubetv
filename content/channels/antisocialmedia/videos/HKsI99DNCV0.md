description: '''Muslim Only Cake Shop'', part two. THIS IS THE ONLY PLACE YOU CAN
  HEAR THIS PODCAST (it won''t be available to download until Mid-April). This is
  a blatant attempt to increase my Youtube channel views (and subscribers). Award-winning
  comedian Bilal Zafar joked on Twitter that he runs a cake shop that only serves
  Muslims. Inevitably bigots and racist reacted and failed to spot the joke. Here
  is part two of an interview with Bilal, from the Anti-Social Media Podcast. Part
  One is available via; Spreaker: iTunes: Soundcloud: Please ''like'' and subscribe
  to the podcast. Please subscribe to this Youtube channel (otherwise this upload
  is rendered ''pointless''!!) Follow us on Twitter: @ASM_Podcast Follow us on Facebook:
