description: 'CONGRATULATIONS to comedian Bilal Zafar, who today was nominated as
  BEST NEWCOMER at the Edinburgh Fringe. Bilal starred in an early podcast episode
  where he discussed how he was abused online, how he took that abuse and turned it
  into comedy, won awards, and turned it all into the Edinburgh show. ANTI-SOCIAL

  Bilal''s Edinburgh show: https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/bilal-zafar-cakes
  It''s a free show but it costs only £4 to reserve tickets, which I highly recommend
  after the nomination. --------------------------- My Twitter: https://twitter.com/ASM_Podcast

  Subscribing and liking videos is great, but if you want to go one stage further
  you can give me a whopping $1.00 a month via Patreon (that''s around £7 per year).
  I will invest in recording equipment (decent camera, editing programmes, pop-shield
  for the mic, etc) with your donations. I am not here to make a profit. I repeat:
  THIS IS A NON-PROFIT PATREON. Thanks for watching. x'
