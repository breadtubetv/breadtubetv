      Name's Ron. I'm 30, I live in Springfield (Illinois), and I'm an activist. By which I mean I'm a fat slob who goes out on marches sometimes. I'm also an anarchist, which means I want to make the system work better for more people.
      Being an activist, I talk about activism-y stuff (from an anarchist perspective, usually). If you want a different, interesting perspective, hey, maybe you'll find it here.
      Goal? Well, the goal of any kind of activism is to engage people. I'm gonna crawl out of the hole I live in, go out into the Youtubes, find folk from all walks of life with all different kinds of ideologies, and see if I can maybe challenge their way of thinking. Or at least find some common ground I and they can work on together. Unless they're bigoted cretins. Not gonna work with bigoted cretins.
      Also, people tell me I'm funny. Sometimes. I keep telling them to stop encouraging me, but they won't listen.
