date: "2019-10-11T14:50:40+08:00"
type: video
description: 'This video discusses the wonderful literature Peter Kropotkin have committed
  to in the name of anarchist communism, anti-fascism, anti-capitalism, and science.
  I hope this serves as an excellent tribute to who he was and the work he''s left
  behind, despite barely scratching the surface. (FUN FACT: Kropotkin was very critical
  of the Rothschild dynasty but he was NOT antisemitic about it. In fact he would
  show up at many protests fighting against pogroms and anti-Jewish fascists. Why
  couldn''t Mikhil Bakunin be that cool? They can''t all be winners). My Social Media
