description: 'I guess this is a new IWW song. Lyrics My boss grinds me to the ground
  Work all night I don’t make a sound Steals my labor and banks on my work ‘see only
  a sliver but that’s just his quirk I don’t wanna live in a capitalist system Where
  we work for the few in classist schism I’ll be free, with my friends, I’m tired
  of this shit Today’s the day told my boss I fucking quit hires more staff throughout
  the day Cuts my hours and reduce my pay Told me to shoot a gun up my nose I fired
  on his clothes with my hose I don’t wanna live in a capitalist system Where we work
  for the few in classist schism I’ll be free, with my friends, I’m tired of this
  shit Today’s the day told my boss I fucking quit I hope the company crumbles and
  smashes down My boss better pack his bags and get outta town my comrades and I are
  unionizing worker’s co ops and I would appreciate if I never had to see another
