description: 'A Rap News summary of the last week''s remarkable events. The decade
  which opened with a ferocious attack upon the United States of America on September
  11, 2001, closes with the announcement of the death of its greatest and most conveniently
  disney-like villain, Osama Bin Laden. In a decade which has been dominated by the
  Empire Strikes Back, our affable and dextrous host Robert Foster invites us to scrutinise
  the events shrouding the killing of this twentyfirst-century Goldstein. Joining
  him in this May retrospective are Rap News regulars, General Baxter, the Pentagon''s
  most effusive spokesperson, attempting uncharacteristically to stay ''on message'',
  and his counterpart from the world of alternative academia, the conspiracy industry''s
  favourite son, Terrence Moonseed. What actually happened in Abbotabad? Do the public
  have a right to see evidence of this event? What is Terrence wearing on his head?
  Was justice really served? What next? History is happening. Juice Rap News: written
  by Giordano Nanni; lyrics and performance by Hugo Farrant. Created by Farrant &
  Nanni in a back-yard studio in suburban Melbourne. +++++++INFORMATION and DOWNLOADS+++++++
