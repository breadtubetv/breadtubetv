  Looks like Obama remembered after all! 5th Dec 2016: "Dakota Access pipeline: US
  denies key permit, a win for Standing Rock protesters" https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/04/dakota-access-pipeline-permit-denied-standing-rock?CMP=share_btn_tw

  "Obama and Native nations have worked hard over eight years to create a special
  and healthy relationship during his tenure. Not a perfect relationship, but definitely
  special. Yet, if he fails to act and kill this Dakota Access Pipeline — a pipeline
  that directly threatens Native treaty rights and also directly threatens Native
  children’s health and well-being — all of that work may be for naught." - Gyasi
