description: 'You''re tuned in to Juice Rap News for the latest update on the great
  human experiment. In today''s broadcast we look at the controversial subject of
  immigration. Mass exoduses of people - refugees, asylum seekers, and migrant workers
  - are taking place all over the planet, causing tensions and tempers to rise. But
  are these really the kinds of immigrants we should be worrying about? And how do
  border-crossing corporations and global treaties like TPP, TTIP and TISA fit into
  the picture? Join Robert Foster as he sets out to shift our perspective broaden
  our understanding of this epoch-defining phase of the great human journey. Written
  & created by Giordano Nanni & Hugo Farrant in a suburban backyard home studio in
  Melbourne, Australia, on Wurundjeri Land. ☛ CREDITS: CONTRIBUTING.md LICENSE README.md
