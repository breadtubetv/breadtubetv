description: 'The US Government made a tourism ad for Hawai''i, and it''s surprisingly
  honest and informative. I had the opportunity to visit Hawai''i at the start of
  the month and talk with local and native Hawaiians. They all said the biggest problem
  they face is the fact that so few people are aware of the history of US military
  occupation. So on my return to Australia, I decided to make a video about it. Giordano
