description: 'Dear friends from all around the world, we have a special announcement
  to make about Juice Rap News. We know that for many of you it will be sad news...
  but by the end of this little video we hope you will join us in celebrating what
  we collectively achieved with Juice Rap News; and that you might be as excited as
  we are about what''s to come on this channel, the Juice Media. We want to thank
  you for your support over the past 6 years; everyone who liked and shared our videos;
  everyone who donated; all our translators from around the world who volunteered
  their time; and all the people who contributed their craft, skills, talents and
  time to Rap News over the years. Thanks to you, we have been able to do some very
  valuable work. It''s been an incredible adventure, and we bring it to a conclusion
  with a sense of sincere accomplishment, and gratitude, for the opportunity we''ve
  been given to play a part. And don''t worry - this is NOT the end of the Juice Media!
  After a bit of a hiatus, there’s going to be some new content coming. The format
  might change, but when the time comes, you can be sure it’s going to have many of
  the qualities which you enjoyed about the content, satire and philosophies of Juice
  Rap News. In the meantime, I (Giordano) am curious to know: what type of content
  would you like to see here on the Juice Media? I will be relying also on YOUR input
  to guide me as I go about planning the next phase of the Juice Media. So please
  leave your comments and thoughts below. Regards & respect your friends on the Internet,
  Giordano & Hugo You can follow Hugo''s poetic work on this channel: https://www.youtube.com/user/jonathanswift'
