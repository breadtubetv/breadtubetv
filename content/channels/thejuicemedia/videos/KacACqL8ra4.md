description: "August 2009: Intervention Update: Indigenous Affairs Minister Jenny
  Macklin has announced that the Commonwealth Government of Australia is going to
  compulsorily acquire Aboriginal Community Town Camps in the Northern Territory.
  This will start happening from early August 2009.   The main focus so far has
  been on the Tangentyere Council which is based in Alice Springs. Tangentyere provides
  services to the 1,600 people from most Central Australian tribal groups living on
  the 18 town camps around the town. Over the years the council has been a spearhead
  for the establishment of other organisations as the need arose, such as Central
  Australian Aboriginal Congress (medical services), Central Australian Aboriginal
  Alcohol Planning Unit (alcohol rehabilitation), Institute for Aboriginal Development
  (educational institution), Central Australian Aboriginal Legal Aid Service, Yipirinye
  School (independent Aboriginal school), outstation resource centres and so on. 
   The NT Intervention took out compulsory 5-year leases over the town camps serviced
  by Tangentyere, along with outstations and other remote communities. The government
  said it needed powers to build housing quickly but not a single house has been built
  for Aboriginal people through the Intervention. Communities across the NT have been
  told that no housing will be built until long-term leases are signed with government.
  Town camps are now under threat of having their living areas compulsorily acquired
  permanently by the Federal Government and their housing stock given to the Northern
  Territory Government to manage. Most town camp residents have experienced tenancy
  under Territory Housing and know it doesnt work for them.  Tangentyere, on behalf
  of its client group, wants to embrace the move taking place nationally towards community
  housing models. With government support they have undergone the process of setting
  up the Central Australian Affordable Housing Company and are keen to move ahead
  with this. They have implored the government to work in partnership with them and
  respect their right to have a say in the plans for their lives and for future generations.
  Town camps are special purpose leases in perpetuity and are set up as Aboriginal
  communal living areas. This is not nepotism: this is how Aboriginal people live
  together and support each other.   A campaign in support of Tangentyere Council,
  its constituent members (the Housing Associations) and retention of its autonomy
  is growing nationally. Many more people need to raise their voices against this
  injustice. We are calling for public endorsement of the Statement opposing the Commonwealths
  proposal to compulsorily acquire the Alice Springs town camps. It is planned to
  publish this Statement and endorsements in the national media on 30 July, on the
  first day of the Australian Labor Partys national conference and one week prior
  to the governments planned takeover date of August 5.   Signed Barbara Shaw
