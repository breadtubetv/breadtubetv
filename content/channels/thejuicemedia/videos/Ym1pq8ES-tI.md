description: '~TheJuiceMedia Invasion Day Report 2010 - the 222nd year of Indigenous
  survival since the invasion of the ''sea people''. In Melbourne, on behalf of the
  Indigenous people of Australia, Robbie Thorpe and Sharon Firebrace publicly read
  out this list of demands, putting the State Government ''on notice''. Each year
  in Australia, 26 January is marked as the national holiday. Why is this so? The
  date does not celebrate the creation of the Australian Federation (which happened
  on 1 January 1901). It commemorates the landing of the First Fleet in 1788 and the
  arrival of the first British settlers, who came to occupy the land in the name of
  King George III of Britain. The day marks the proclamation of British (_not_Australian!)
  sovereignty over the entire continent. Moreover: the 1788 occupation was justified
  under the legal doctrine of ''terra nullius'' (= ''empty land'') which maintained
  that the entire country was uninhabited. This was obviously a fiction and (eventually)
  was even rejected by the highest Court in Australia in the Mabo judgment in 1992.
  ''Australia Day'' is not only a misnomer, then, it also celebrates a LIE. Aren''t
  these good reasons to change this holiday to a more appropriate date!?? Among most
  Indigenous people in Australia, 26 January is more accurately known as ''Invasion
  Day'' or ''Survival Day''. Lastly: British occupiers never signed a Treaty with
  any Indigenous groups. Therefore, the occupation of the land is still based on the
  doctrine of ''terra nullius'', since nothing has replaced it in law. Only a treaty
  can justify the occupation. Until then it remains illegal even by the invaders''
  standards. For more information: http://www.treatyrepublic.net/'
