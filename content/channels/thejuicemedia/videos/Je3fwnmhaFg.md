description: "Izzy Brown, a friend of The Juice Media, produced this mini-doco in
  2004 with more Juicy information on the Save Lake Cowal campaign. It is an educational
  recent historical perspective for your intellectual refreshment. For more of Izzy's
  awesome videos and music please visit:  http://www.myspace.com/izzylabrat
    Lake Cowal is situated 47km north-east of West Wyalong, central western New
  South Wales and is the biggest inland lake in the state. It is protected under two
  international agreements on migratory birds with Japan (JAMBA) and China (CAMBA),
  it is also listed on the national heritage register as a significant wetland, and
  home to many native and endangered species. Lake Cowal is an ephemeral lake that
  floods into the Lachlan river catchments which leads to the Murrumbidgie and Murray
  Rivers.  Canadian Gold mining company Barrick has proposed to mine at Lake Cowal
  using cyanide and lethal chemicals. This mine will be an open cut mine 1km long,
  325m deep (the height of Centre Point Tower) and 825m wide on the very edge of the
  lake. The low-grade ore that is dug up is sprayed with a cyanide solution that leaches
  out tiny gold flecks; the waste cyanide is then transported through pipes to tailings
  dams 3.5km from the Lake. The dams are left open so that cyanide can break down.
  There are close to a hundred toxic chemicals that are breakdown products of cyanide,
  there are also heavy metals that remain from this process which are a threat to
  health. One teaspoon of a 2% solution can kill an adult human.  Activists travelled
  to Lake Cowal in October 2004 to challenge Barrick and act in solidarity with local
  indigenous people."
