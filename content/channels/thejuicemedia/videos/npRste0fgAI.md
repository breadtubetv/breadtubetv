description: 'In a galaxy far far away... on October 9th, 2009, the Earth carried
  out its first attack on a neighbouring celestial body by bombing its trusty moon
  with a missile/rocket/thing, in the name of SCIENCE! Is this a worthy attempt to
  aid humanity with its energy crisis; or the hallmarks of an aggressive space-faring
  civilisation in the making? (or an NWO/NASA/Roswell/Bildeberg/Illuminati conspiracy?)
