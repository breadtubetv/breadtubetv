description: 'Today we travel into the pure world of sci-fi to investigate the much
  vaunted, mysterious potential future event known as ''The Singularity''. What will
  a machine consciousness mean for humanity? What are the ethical, political, military
  and philosophical implications of strong A.I.? And what would an AI sound like when
  spitting rhymes over a dope beat? All this and more shall be revealed in Rap News
  28: The Singularity - featuring a special appearance from famed technocrat, futurist
  and inventor, Ray Kurzweil, in full TED talk mode; everyone''s favourite warmonger,
  General Baxter; and we welcome back the dauntless info warrior Alex Jones, who last
  made an appearance in RN6. Join Robert Foster on this epic Sci-Fi quest into the
  future/past of humanity. Written & created by Giordano Nanni & Hugo Farrant in a
  suburban backyard home studio in Melbourne, Australia, on Wurundjeri Land. ☛ CONNECT
