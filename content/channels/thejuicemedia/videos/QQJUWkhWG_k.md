description: "The Juice speaks to Les Malezer just after his delivery of the 2009
  Mabo Lecture in Melbourne on June 3rd. We asked him a few questions about the road
  ahead for Australia and Aboriginal Land Rights. Here are some of the key juicy points
  made:  1. The Australian Government is under certain human rights obligations
  which it is not fulfilling. --Especially so since it signed the United Nations Declaration
  on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples: http://www.hreoc.gov.au/social_justice/declaration/assembly.html
    2. There is a need to depart from the Native Title process and to go back
  to focusing on Land Rights: \"We have to forget about using the Native Title process;
  it's not working. Lets insist upon a land Rights process, like the one we started
  in 1985 with the Hawke Government, when they promised us National Land Rights Legislation.\"
   3. The Government must start focusing on OUTCOMES rather than processes- for
  instance, setting quotas aside (eg 5% of the State) for Aboriginal land. The system
  must cease putting claimants through bureaucratic hoops. It must instead address
  the obligations it has towards Aboriginal peoples -- ie: restitution of land.
   4. Treaty is the way to go to address the unresolved Australian situation. It
  establishes the principles of Rights. The UN Declaration provides a platform to
  allow Aboriginal Peoples to make their own governments and treaties--  Treaty:
  \"We may as well get people used to the word\"  5. Human rights obligations
  and International pressure, rather than public pressure, are needed to push Government
  to form treaties. It is then the Governement's job to explain to Australians why
  it is necessary to make such treaties.  Unfortunately, due to noisy lawn tractors
  operating on the pitch, parts of the interview have been edited out :(   Filmed
