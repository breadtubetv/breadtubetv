description: "Barbara Shaw, from Mt Nancy town camp near Alice Springs, talks in Melbourne
  on 27th August 2009 about the Northern territory Intervention, which began in 2007
  under the Howard Government and is being extended under the Rudd Labour Government.
    Indigenous Affairs Minister Jenny Macklin announced in July '09 that Town
  Camps in the NT would be paid $100m to sign 40 year leases making the residents
  tenants under the Territory Government. Should they refuse, Macklin threatened,
  the Government will compulsorily acquire the town camps under the special powers
  provided by the Emergency Response Legislation, which was pushed through Parliament
  in 2007.   In response, Barbara Shaw has lodged two injuctions - or 'stays of
  execution' - against Macklin, stating that she did not inform the tenants that their
  right were going to be extinguished. The Federal Court will now proceed to a full
  hearing on Monday August 31st.   More to come in the next few days...

   Also, very importantly, the UN Special Rapporteur on the Situation of Human Rights
  and Fundamental Freedoms of Indigenous Peoples, Prof James Anaya, has recently visited
  the Northern Territory on a 11 day trip (17-28 August 2009). He also met with Barbara
  Shaw, who introduced him to one of the town camps near Alice. His report has condemned
  the Northern Territory Intervention as 'Racist' and he has urged Canberra to reinstate
  the Racial Discrimination Act asap. Anaya will present the Report to the UN at the
  next Human Rights Council meeting. Take a read of the Report here:  http://www.unhchr.ch/huricane/huricane.nsf/view01/313713727C084992C125761F00443D60?opendocument
   Both the Government and the Opposition have responded in the most embarrassing
  manner possible, by choosing to completely disregard the Report of this distinguished
  Rapporteur:  Tony Abbott: 'Abbott says calls from UN expert Anaya \"nonsense\"'
  http://www.news.com.au/story/0,27574,25992824-29277,00.html  And Warren Mundine:
  'Warren Mundine ~versus~ James Anaya' http://slackbastard.anarchobase.com/?p=6610
   And of course, Rupert Murdoch's opinion in The Australian: 'He came, he saw and
  missed the point' http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,25995837-16741,00.html"
