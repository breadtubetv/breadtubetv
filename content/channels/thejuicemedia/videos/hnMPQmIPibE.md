description: 'A Rap News summary of the past week''s remarkable series of events.
  It started off as a slow news day, and a routine update on the state of the Free
  World Order with NSA Director General Baxter. But then the news broke of startling
  revelations from the fearless paladin of adversarial journalism, guardian of civil
  liberties, journalist Glen Greenwald, concerning a shadowy spying program called
  PRISM. Who is behind these revelations, and how should we view them? How will the
  Authorities, and the Corporations implicated, respond? Join Robert Foster for a
  whirlwind summary of the events in this ongoing saga... in Rap News 19 - Written
  & created by Giordano Nanni & Hugo Farrant in a suburban backyard home-studio in
  Melbourne, Australia - on Wurundjeri Land. CONTRIBUTING.md LICENSE README.md archetypes
