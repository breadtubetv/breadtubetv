description: "On July 14 2009 we, Elders from the Ampilatwatja community, walked out
  of our houses and set up camp in the bush. We are fed up with the federal government's
  Northern Territory Intervention, controls and measures, visions and goals forced
  onto us from outside. We felt we were outcasts and isolated from all decision making
  -there has been no meaningful consultation... We therefore have no intention of
  going back there. We intend to stay here until our demands are met.   I would
  like to send a personal invitation to all our brothers and sisters, who are leaders
  and workers in their Aboriginal organisations to come together as one people. I
  would like to share with you the visions of our leaders and Elders and the path
  we have chosen to honour the lines of our country, mother Earth, our dreaming and
  spirituality. Brothers and sisters, we are one and we are part of you. We are all
  connected through mother Earth. This is the true line we must follow to unite and
  to bring all our white brothers and sisters on this journey with us. We have many
  struggles and journeys ahead. The time is now. It is vital that we come together
  to listen to each other and share our thoughts and ideas on the way forward. What
  will be the future for our aboriginal people across this country? I look forward
  to meeting many of you on the tour and hope to create lasting friendships and connections
  so that we can work towards creating a better future for our younger generations.\"

   During October '09, Ampilatwatja's spokesperson, Richard Downs, conducted a speaking-tour
  along the east coast of Australia, talking at Universities, Workers' Unions, Indigenous
  communities and at public rallies in Sydney, Melbourne, Canberra, Brisbane, raising
  awareness of the walk-off and appealing for funds to help the walkoff camp to remain
  self-sufficient.   Accompanying Richard, Warlpiri Elder, Harry Nelson, of the
  Yuendemu community talked about his own struggle to fight the Government's attempt
  to force communities in the Northern Territory to sign 40 year leases, thus handing
  over their lands to Government.  This video covers footage of Richard and Harry's
  speaking tour in Melbourne: 14-16 October.   Video of Richard and Harry talking
