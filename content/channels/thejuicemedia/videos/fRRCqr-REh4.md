description: 'Today on Rap News, a world exclusive: Pope Francis performing his 2015
  encyclical on climate change, revealing his new, revised Ten Climate Commandments
  for the care of our common home. Of course, Robert Foster also has a couple of pointed
  questions to pose to the Pontiff; as does our resident conspiracy pioneer, Terrence
  Moonseed. Join us as we beam in to the Vatican to hear Pope Francis spit hot fire
  on global warming. It’s Pope Francis vs Climate Change… Lord help us. Written &
  created by Giordano Nanni & Hugo Farrant in a suburban backyard home studio in Melbourne,
  Australia, on Wurundjeri Land. ☛ CREDITS: CONTRIBUTING.md LICENSE README.md archetypes
