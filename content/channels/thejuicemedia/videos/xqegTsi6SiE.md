  -- You can also write to the Attorney General Christian Porter asking him to exercise
  his power under s.71 of the Judiciary Act to drop the prosecution of Witness K and
  Bernard Collaery. Here’s his email christian.porter.mp@aph.gov.au (please keep it
  clean). -- Lastly, you can help raise awareness about this whole shitshow by sharing
