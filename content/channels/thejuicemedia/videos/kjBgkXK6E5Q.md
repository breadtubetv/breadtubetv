description: 'Robert Foster presents an express Rap News Call Out report featuring
  correspondent Ken Oathcarn, who''s found himself in one of the most incredible areas
  of natural beauty in the world - the Great Barrier Reef! Surely nobody would be
  allowed to dredge, damage and dump coal dust all over this natural wonder of the
  world? Well, that very much depends on you... ☛ 4 STEPS YOU CAN TAKE TO HELP SAVE

  to finance Adani & Abbot Point: https://www.getup.org.au/campaigns/great-barrier-reef--3/contact-your-bank/contact-your-bank
  2. Check this list to find out which banks and credit unions do not invest in fossil
  fuels, and if necessary switch to them instead: http://www.marketforces.org.au/banks/compare

  one of the following groups campaigning for the reef: - Fight For The Reef https://fightforthereef.org.au
