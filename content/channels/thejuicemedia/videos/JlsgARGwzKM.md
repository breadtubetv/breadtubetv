description: "April 19, 2010 Cochabamba, Bolivia.  Forget corporate climate politics
  in Copenhagen: the World People's Conference on Climate Change and the rights of
  Mother Earth is currently being held in Cochambamba, Bolivia, hosted by president
  Evo Morales. Key on the agenda is to press for a global referendum on climate-change
  and the creation of a Climate Justice Court at the United Nations.  Voices of
  the People:  Day 1, 7:30am. Though the conference has not been officially inaugurated
  by Bolivian President Evo Morales, bus loads of people are pouring in at the Universidad
  del Valle, Tiquipaya, Cochabamba. People from various parts of the world, people
  from different ethnic groups in Bolivia are gathered outside the gate of the university.
   Why have these people decided to attend this conference? We asked a few people
  from the crowd this and their hopes of what this conference could achieve.
