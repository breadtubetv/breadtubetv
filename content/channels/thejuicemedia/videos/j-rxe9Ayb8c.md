date: "2019-12-07T13:47:21+08:00"
type: video
description: 'The year we''ve all been waiting for - 2012AD (or 13.0.0.0.0, if you
  ask a Mayan) - is finally here. What will happen? Will we see the poles shift or
  a paradigm shift? Will a rogue Sumerian planet smash into our solar system, plunging
  us into serfdom under the iron fist of a race of gold-hungry aliens? Or are the
  aliens already here? Or are all these merely humanity''s collective projections
  of itself as it careens towards an ever-accelerating super-connected cyber-reality
  - whatever that means... One thing''s sure, if 2011 was a prelude of things to come,
  2012 is going to be one hell of a year. Now that it has arrived, are we ready? Join
  your host Robert Foster and his guests, Terrence Moonseed and General Baxter, as
  they conduct an in-depth rap analysis into the future, and humanity''s place in
  it. Happy New YERA! Juice Rap News: written by Giordano Nanni; lyrics and performance
  by Hugo Farrant. Created by Farrant & Nanni in a back-yard studio in suburban Melbourne.
