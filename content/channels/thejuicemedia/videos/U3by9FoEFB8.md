description: 'Decades of failed peace talks have led nowhere; but do not lose hope
  just yet. Join Robert Foster as he attempts to host the first ever Middle East Peace
  Raps, using rhyme and reason to bring together Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin "Bibi"
  Netanyahu, and a representative of Hamas. The picture would not be complete however,
  without a discussion of "America''s last taboo" (as Edward Said once referred to
  it): the USA''s role as Israel''s best - and only - buddy in the world (Ok, together
  with Australia). Featuring special cameos from prominent American Jewish scholar,
  Dr. Norman Finkelstein, and Palestinian rap legends, DAM, this is an episode for
  the ages. Join us as we bravely (or perhaps stupidly) take on one of the most bitter,
  divisive and controversial conflicts of our times: Israel & Palestine. Written &
  created by Giordano Nanni & Hugo Farrant in a suburban backyard home studio in Melbourne,
  Australia, on Wurundjeri Land. **CREDITS: MUSIC: Main beat: "Look Away" by Profetesa:
