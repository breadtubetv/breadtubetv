description: 'The News" - the most viral meme of reality on the planet. If it''s not
  on "the News" it didn''t happen - right? Welcome back to Season 2 of Juice Rap News,
  in which intrepid anchorman Robert Foster embarks on a new era of adversarial rap
  journalism by casting a critical eye on the paradigm that shapes our collective
  reality each night; featuring a smorgasbord of guests, from the stalwart General
  Baxter and Terence Moonseed having a friendly chat on about the Trans-Pacific Partnership
  (TPP), to our special correspondents in Russia and the Colonies. Meanwhile, what
  is going on in Finance, Show­biz and the Weather? Special surprise guests are in
  tow to cover all this and more, helping Robert delve deeper into this very odd phenomenon
  of ''The News'' itself. ­Written & created by Giordano Nanni & Hugo Farrant in a
  suburban backyard home studio in Melbourne, Australia, ­on Wurundjeri Land. **CREDITS:
