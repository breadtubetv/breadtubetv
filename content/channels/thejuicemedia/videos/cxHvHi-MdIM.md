description: 'Do guns really prevent tyranny? Is tyranny already here? Welcome, Minutemen,
  to Rap News 18, where we take a few minutes to explore one of the great debates
  taking place in the Divided States of America. It seems that no matter how high
  the body count on the latest attempt at topping the civilian shoot''em-up high-score
  table, this perennial debate shows no sign of abating, having morphed into a vigorous
  exegisis of the 2nd Command...err.... Amendment, as Americans seek to make sense
  of the original intentions of the great con-Founding Fathers. Persuasive arguments
  have been levied from both sides; and yet both have failed to convince the other.
  Is this the quintessential impasse? Join Robert Foster as he sets out to squeeze
  the juice from this most explosive of current debates - featuring our two special
  regular guests: that son of a gun Terence Moonseed, and the big gun General Baxter.
