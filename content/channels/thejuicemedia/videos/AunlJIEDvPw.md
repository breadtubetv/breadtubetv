description: "civil disobedience: 22 people arrested and 500+ protesting at Hazelwood
  in direct action against the dirtiest and most harmful coal-powered station in the
  world.   HAZELWOOD POWER STATION - is one of the dirtiest power stations in
  the industrialised world, emitting 17megatonnes of CO2 annually. International Power
  Hazelwood employs 520 people.  Hazelwood was scheduled to be decommissioned
  by 2009 due to its excessive carbon dioxide emissions, however the State Government
  in 2005 extended its life until 2031.  The action is intended to show that the
  social licence to continue to burn coal and pollute has been revoked. We are declaring
  a Community Decommission Order on Hazelwood, to switch on the renewable energy transition.
   Speakers included: Robbie Thorpe - representative of the Gunai/Kurnai - owners
  of the land in the La Trobe valley, Scott Ludlum, Green Senator for WA, and Dave
  Sweeney, Australian Conservation Foundation, ACF.  THE POLICE RESPONSE: HOW
  OUR TAX DOLLARS ARE SPENT. The policing operation was reported to have cost in excess
  of $200,000 with 250 officers present including horses, dogs, the helicopter and
  boats on the pondage. The visible presence was about 100 officers along the fence
  line. Police had constructed a temporary fence about 100 metres beyond the real
  perimeter of the plant. This allowed demonstrators to breach the first police line
  and be arrested without actually getting too close to the plant, something the police
  obviously intended. Police did appear to lose patience by about 3 PM as the protestors
  held a final spokes council to decide on how to end the day. The meeting was buzzed
  low by the police helicopter and police liason were told that any mass charge on
  the fence to finish the day would be met with the use of capsicum foam. That was
  their subtle way of saying, it was time to go home.  Arrestees were charged
  with Trespass and were told they will be charged on summons to appear in the Morewell
  Courts at a later date. They were processed on site. One protestor was charged with
  assaulting police after allegedly colliding with a police officer after jumping
  the fence. Organisers have pledged legal support and solidarity fundraising will
  occur for all those arrested.  Want to know when these events are taking place?
