type: video
description: 'The time has come to turn our focus onto the very medium which allows
  us to connect: The Internet. As we know it today, it has only been around for a
  short time: it''s still an adolescent; still changing and growing. But even as we
  speak, powerful forces and interests are vying to influence and shape it’s nature
  as it reaches full maturity. And since humanity’s destiny and that of the Internet
  are intimately connected, it would be wise to be ask: how is the Internet doing?
  If the Internet could speak to us as a human today, what kind of person would it
  be? And most importantly, what kind of a person will it become in the future? Log
  in with Robert Foster as he poses these very questions to some of the most influential
  and powerful figures who are today shaping the Internet’s future. Featuring an world-exclusive,
  world-first appearance from the Internet itself. Only on Juice Rap News. Written
  by Giordano Nanni, Rhymed & Performed by Hugo Farrant - in a suburban backyard home
  studio in Melbourne, Australia, on Wurundjeri Land. ☛ CREDITS: CONTRIBUTING.md LICENSE
