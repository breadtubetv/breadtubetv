description: 'Back by popular demand, Robert Foster turns his attention to the soaring
  Orwellian rhetoric hailing from Oslo, where Barack Obama is currently receiving
  the prestigious Nobel War-is-Peace prize. This second episode of Rap News covers
  the fallout from the now infamous NASA Moon Bomb on October 9th, the very same day
  on which the Nobel Committee awarded US President Barack Obama the 2009 ''War is
  Peace'' Prize. Is it justified? Is it premature or plain immature? And what will
  the Moon say?! Was this a prize for peace-making or for making war look like peace,
  something Bush was not able to do? And why do we even care what these Norwegian
  guys do. All this, and more, in this latest report with Robert Foster on ~JuiceMedia''s
  Rap News. Juice Rap News: written & created by Giordano Nanni and Hugo Farrant in
  a back-yard studio in suburban Melbourne, on Wurundjeri Land. Download MP3 and Lyrics
