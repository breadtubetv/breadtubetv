  -*- SOURCES AND FURTHER READING: 1. Here''s the report by Orima on the trials, however
  it''s not easy to interpret these results: https://www.dss.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/08_2017/cashless_debit_card_trial_evaluation_-_final_evaluation_report.pdf
  2. So I recommend you check out the explanation of the results by Dr Janet Hunt,
  from ANU: https://caepr.cass.anu.edu.au/sites/default/files/docs/CAEPR_Topical_Issues_1_2017_0.pdf
  3. Here''s the evidence for the claim that the Cashless Debit Card is: • Ineffective
  - see Auditor General report which says there was no evidence that it reduces social
  harm (Australian National Audit Office (ANAO), 2018) • Expensive - it costs over
  $10-12,000 per person (see ANAO, 2018 and Senate Committee hearings) • Harmful –
  32 per cent of respondents to the government evaluation said it made their lives
  worse (Orima, 2017) • Unsupported - the government evaluation acknowledged that
  the CDCT did not have universal support from the local community (Orima, 2017) •
  Discriminatory - breaches human rights of privacy and social security (Parliamentary
  Joint Committee on Human Rights, Community Affairs Legislation Committee, 2018)
  • Paternalistic - it removes people''s agency to manage their affairs (Parliamentary
  Joint Committee on Human Rights, Community Affairs Legislation Committee, 2018).
