date: "2019-12-07T13:47:11+08:00"
type: video
description: 'It''s nearing the end of 2012, and the bastion of world democracy (The
  United States of America) is displaying its free and open process of elections for
  the world to observe. As is customary every four years, the rigorous selection process
  has served up a number of philosopher kings and queens from which to choose. But
  why have so many choices when with a bit of effort you can whittle it down to two
  candidates and let the people pick from those? Especially when it makes for such
  scintillating debates. Join Juice Rap News stalwart host Robert Foster as he shares
  his dreams for the Presidential Debates... and then receives something of a rude
  awakening. - Written & created by Giordano Nanni & Hugo Farrant in a suburban backyard
  home-studio in Melbourne, Australia - on Wurundjeri Land. - Gratitude to our donors
