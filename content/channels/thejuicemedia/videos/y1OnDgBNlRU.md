type: video
description: 'We''ve all heard of EuroVision. But there''s another song that’s being
  sung across Europe - the peoples'' chants of protest against Europe''s austerity
  measures. First we''ll hear some of the leading and loudest voices in this competition
  such as Greece, Spain and Ireland, who are fighting back against austerity with
  people power. Then we''ll turn to the contest''s illustrious judges: Germany''s
  Chancellor Angela Merkel, Slovenian philosopher-rockstar Slavoj Žižek, and IMF dminatrix,
  err... director, Christine Lagarde. Join Robert Foster as he examines the Eurozone
  crisis and the causes behind it: Is it all economics and budgets? Is this ideological
  class war? What are the solutions? And what on earth is Australia doing competing
  in this EuroZone song contest? All these questions and more will be tackled as we
  dive into this most bizarre of modern European traditions. Welcome to the EURODIVISION
  CONTEST. Written & created by Giordano Nanni & Hugo Farrant in a suburban backyard
  home studio in Melbourne, Australia, on Wurundjeri Land. ☛ CREDITS: CONTRIBUTING.md
