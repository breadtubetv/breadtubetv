description: 'Welcome to this exclusive Rap News broadcast, helmed by the veteran
  anchor, and Iraq War Hero, Brian Washington. Today we seek to understand the cause
  of the tension which has gripped the Police States of America following the seemingly
  unstoppable deaths of black people at the hands of Officers of the Piece. What is
  the cause of these #BlackLivesMatters hastags and the protests erupting around the
  country? What is this ‘R-‘ word that everyone keeps bandying about…? What about
  that ‘history’ thing? Featuring newly installed Chief of Militarised Police, General
  Baxter, and a guest from the ‘Civil Rights’ movement, one Marvin Uggenrite, join
  indefatigable warrior for truth, Brian Washington, as he attempts to get to the
  bottom of this… or scrape the bottom of the barrel trying. For the first time ever
  Juice Rap News tunes into the Main Stream Media BS frequency for an entire episode…
  what could possibly go wrong? Written & created by Giordano Nanni & Hugo Farrant
  in a suburban backyard home studio in Melbourne, Australia, on Wurundjeri Land.
