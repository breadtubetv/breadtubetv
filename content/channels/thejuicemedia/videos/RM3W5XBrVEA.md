  But fear not: we might just be able to get the job done ourselves. Join Robert Foster
  as he sets out to discover where Civilisation™ is making the fastest progress towards
  annihilation. In this edition of the Civilisation Report, Robert learns about Australia
  and Canada - two oft-neglected pioneers of peace, progress and prosperity - in conversation
  with our antipodean colonial correspondent Ken Oathcarn and his Canuck counterpart,
  Fagin Heighbard. Dear viewers, consider this a fair warning that in terms of language
  and affront to the dominant culture this could get fucking messy. - Written & created
  by Giordano Nanni & Hugo Farrant in a suburban backyard home-studio in Melbourne,
  Australia - on Wurundjeri Land. - Gratitude to our donors whose generosity has made
