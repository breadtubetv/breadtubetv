  Day (Jan 26th) 2009. "I can't walk around with my shoes on, my natural shoes that
  I was born with - the 60,000 year old shoes? I can't apparently. I shouldnt; people
  worry for me. Consider your cultural design people. You're stopping yourself from
  living." This is the very first video interview by the Juice Media.
