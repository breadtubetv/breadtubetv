description: 'Welcome to Rap News. The G20 Summit is happening and the leaders of
  the wealthiest nations on the planet are converging on Australia to come and learn
  directly at the feet of the master of fascist dystopian fuckwittery: Tony Abbott.
  Join the noble Australian Prime Minister as he lists his recent achievements and
  launches the opening of the G20 Summit in Australia, backed by a faithful and compliant
  mainstream media, represented by our favourite local correspondent Ken Oathcarn.
  This episode features a magical cameo from Wizard Senator Scott Ludlam, who has
  been campaigning tirelessly in speeches to empty Senate rooms to stop the Government’s
  proposed mandatory data retention laws - coming up soon for a vote in the Senate.
  After this G20 episode, no one will be in any doubt why Australia is leading the
  civilised world in the global race to towards 1984. Written & created by Giordano
  Nanni & Hugo Farrant in a suburban backyard home studio in Melbourne, Australia,
  on Wurundjeri Land. Special thanks to Scott Ludlam for working with us on this video.
