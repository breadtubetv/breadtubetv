description: "Ms Gracelyn Smallwood has been a tireless advocate for improved outcomes
  in Indigenous Health for over forty years. Since qualifying as a registered nurse
  - one of the few employment options open to Aboriginal women in Townsville in the
  early 1970s - Gracelyn has championed the improvement of health, in particular Indigenous
  Health and HIV- AIDS prevention and has gained national and international recognition
  in both mainstream and cultural public health spheres.  Gracelyn was awarded
  Queensland Aboriginal of the Year in 1986; an Order of Australia medal in 1992 for
  service to public health, particularly HIV-AIDS education; and in 1994 was the first
  woman, Indigenous person and non-paediatrician to receive the Henry Kemp Memorial
  Award at the International Society for Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect.
   Gracelyn currently works at the largely Indigenous Cleveland Youth Detention
  Centre as nurse and mentor, and at Townsville Hospital as a nurse and midwife. She
  is an Associate Professor and Indigenous Advisor to the Vice-Chancellor at James
  Cook University and has been a driving person behind James Cook University's progressive
  Reconciliation Statement."
