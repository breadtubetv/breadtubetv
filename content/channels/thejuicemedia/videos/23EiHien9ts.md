description: (Uploaded in 2012). This festive season, while many of us enjoy feeling
  the bosoms of our families, we at Juice Rap News feel it is important to remember
  those much much much much less fortunate than us. And in the time honoured tradition
  of misguided Western pop charity singles, we invited the legendary Irish piece of
  shit, (Cui) Bono to resurrect the execrable post colonial anthem 'Do They Know It's
  Christmas?' in which he featured during the 1980's. By Giordano & Hugo; performed
  by Giordano; vocals by Damian Tapley and Luke Ferris from ME (the original ungoogleables).
  This originally formed part of the 7th episode of Juice Rap News, '#Revolution Spreads
  to America' (which we still refer to in hush tones as 'the epic-sode'). See you
  in the "new" year! Hugo & Giordano JUICE RAP NEWS
