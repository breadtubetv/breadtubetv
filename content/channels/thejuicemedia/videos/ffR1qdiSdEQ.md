description: 'RAP NEWS 21 [S02E01] (MULTILINGUAL VERSION). "The News". It''s the most
  viral meme of reality on the planet: if it''s not on "the News" it didn''t happen
  - right? Welcome back to Season 2 of Juice Rap News, in which intrepid anchorman
  Robert Foster embarks on a new era of adversarial rap journalism by casting a critical
  eye on the paradigm that shapes our collective reality each night; featuring a smorgasbord
  of guests, from the stalwart General Baxter and Terence Moonseed having a friendly
  chat on about the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), to our special correspondents
  in Russia and the Colonies. Meanwhile, what is going on in Finance, Show­biz and
  the Weather? Special surprise guests are in tow to cover all this and more, helping
  Robert delve deeper into this very odd phenomenon of ''The News'' itself. ­Written
  & created by Giordano Nanni & Hugo Farrant in a suburban backyard home studio in
  Melbourne, Australia, ­on Wurundjeri Land. CONTRIBUTING.md LICENSE README.md archetypes
