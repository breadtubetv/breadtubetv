  “Rather than a creature of power and interest, the self becomes capital to be invested
  in, enhanced according to specified criteria and norms as well as available inputs
  [...] no longer are citizens most importantly constituent elements of sovereignty,
  members of publics, or ever bearers of rights. Rather, as human capital, they may
  contribute or be a drag on economic growth; they may be invested in or divested
  from depending on their potential for GDP enhancement” Wendy Brown, "Undoing the
