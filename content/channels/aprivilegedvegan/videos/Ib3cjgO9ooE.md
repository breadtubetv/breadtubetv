  created on Palestinian land, was meant to take anywhere from 52% to 56% of the land
  that was once Palestine, with the rest going to the Palestinians. When the Zionists
  came in they started going around from town to town, massacring the Palestinians
  and forcing them out in what is called the ''Nakba''. Many of those Palestinians
  who were forced out and their descendants are still living as refugees today. However,
  in some areas, the Palestinians were ''allowed'' to stay, provided they submitted
  to living as second class citizens under the laws of the new state. Those Palestinians
  and their descendants became Israeli citizens--and therefore had some legal rights,
  whereas the others, who were driven out into the Palestinian territories or who
  lived in those areas in the first place, did not. In response to the Nakba, the
  surrounding countries jumped in to the Palestinians'' defense in an attack on the
  newly-formed state of Israel. They lost, and Israel took over more of the land--a
  LOT more. By the 1950''s, Israel had taken over 78% of the land, leaving the Palestinians
  with only 22%. In 1967, there was the Six Day War, where Israel took over that remaining
  22% of land, so that then they controlled ALL of what had once been Palestine--100%
  of the land. Even though it is illegal by the standards of international law, they
  still occupy the Palestinian territories today. *That* is what is meant by the "illegal
  occupation of Palestine"--not Israel itself, which is the 78% of what was originally
  the country of Palestine, but their ongoing military occupation of that last 22%.
  That is also where the Jews-Only settlements are--because unlike Israel itself,
  that land is still being actively colonized. In the occupied territories the population
  is Palestinian, and the only Israelis that live there live in these fortress-like
  settlements that are surrounded by barbed wire fences and guarded by the occupying
  Israeli army. That''s in the West Bank--in Gaza, there are no Israelis living there
  now, but the entire area and all of its borders are controlled by Israel, where
  the Palestinian inhabitants can''t leave or come back without Israeli permission,
  and where the Israelis have been intentionally blocking them from being able to
  import or export anything. 2) There is a difference between Palestinians living
  in the Israeli-occupied Palestinian territories, or as permanent refugees in other
  countries, and the Palestinians living within ‘Israel'' itself. At the time of the
  creation of the Israeli state back in 1948, some of the Palestinians were ''allowed''
  to stay in their homes provided they accepted living as 2nd or 3rd class citizens
  under the new Jewish state. Those Palestinians and their descendants became Israeli
  citizens, whereas the others, in the occupied territories, never did. The ones with
  Israeli citizenship are often referred to as ''Israeli Arabs'', and although they
  are denied many rights in Israel, they do at least have SOME rights under Israeli
  law. This is used by Israeli propaganda, because the Israelis say: look! they have
  rights under our ''democracy'', their situation is far better than it would be in
  many Muslim countries, etc. (Which is terribly racist and Islamophobic, but I digress.)
  And while the ''Israeli Arabs'' who live within Israel do have some rights, the
  Palestinians living in the Israeli-occupied territories of Gaza, the West Bank and
  East Jerusalem have NO rights under Israeli law, are NOT citizens of Israel--and
  in fact, have no recognized citizenship in any country. That is why Israelis can
  kill them, torture them, maim them with such impunity. Hardly anyone in the West
  realizes this, the vast majority of Westerners who go there only go to Israel itself
  and not the occupied territories, and thus they can simply pretend it doesn''t exist.
