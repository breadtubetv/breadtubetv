description: 'Since Donald Trump''s election, so many people who want to get involved
  and make a positive difference. Becoming vegan is one of the most impactful decisions
  you can make. Not only will you drastically reduce your carbon footprint, but by
  including animals in your anti-oppression framework, you will become a more effective
  advocate for social justice. As BIGD_OTheVegan said in the comments, "Take a stand
  against the ideologies that Trump pumps!!!" What better time than now to take a
  30 day vegan pledge! You can (and should) do it!!! Ultimately, we all need to be
  vegan for life, but this is just a start to lure you in.... because once you make
  the connection, you''ll never want to go back :D Want to take the pledge but don''t
