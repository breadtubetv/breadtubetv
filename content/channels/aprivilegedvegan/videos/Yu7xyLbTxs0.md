  recommend the book I was reading on the train to anyone interested in trans rights
  and effective social justice advocacy. It’s called “Normal Life: Administrative
  Violence, Critical Trans Politics, and the Limits of Law” by Dean Spade: https://www.amazon.com/Normal-Life-Administrative-Violence-Critical/dp/0822360403
