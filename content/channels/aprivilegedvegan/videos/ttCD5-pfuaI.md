description: 'What do systems of ‘othering’ have to do with climate change? “Othering”
  is another matrix through which to examine oppression. It reminds us why a pro-intersectional
  approach to ecological, economic, and social justice is fundamental: our fight for
  freedom must refuse all hierarchies that rank the relative value of living beings.
  Unfortunately, Naomi Klein does not consider speciesism as a system of ‘othering’.
  She hasn’t directly addressed the topic but does not advocate for a vegan diet/
  lifestyle. Nonetheless, this video was inspired by her work on the othering of humans
  and climate change– I just took the concept and expanded it further. I just wanted
  to make that clear, and not risk attributing ideas to her that aren’t hers (for
  better or worst). Follow me on Facebook! www.facebook.com/aprivilegedvegan Support
