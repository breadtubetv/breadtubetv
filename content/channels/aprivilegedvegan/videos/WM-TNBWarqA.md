type: video
description: "In this video I talk about the flint water crisis, environmental racism,
  and finish off with a short rant about single issue vegans who deny that racism
  exists and then appropriate MLK day to fit their agenda. **ANNOTATION** It has been
  brought to my attention that the Salvation Army has a nasty history of furthering
  the oppression of marginalized communities. I recommend sticking to the afore mentioned
  Flint Water Project of the United Way of Genesee. For more information on the salvation
  army: https://libcom.org/library/starvation-army-twelve-reasons-reject-salvation-army
