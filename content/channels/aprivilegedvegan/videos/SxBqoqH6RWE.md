  To leave you with another killer quote by Sunaura Taylor: "Ableist values are central
  to animal industries, where the dependency, vulnerability, and presumed lack of
  emotional awareness or intellectual capacity of animals creates the groundwork for
  a system that makes billions of dollars in profit each year. The very norms and
  institutions that perpetuate animal suffering and exploitation are supported by
  ableism” (59)'
