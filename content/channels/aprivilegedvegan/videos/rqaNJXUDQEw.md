description: 'Hi everyone! Today I interview Samantha on my channel. She talks about
  how she worked with her community to create an African-centered vegan homeschool
  out of her living room in Brooklyn. Samantha also talks about the fact that Black
  families is the single fastest homeschooling group in the U.S., and that homeschooling
  has the potential to create revolutionary change and empower communities of color.
  Samantha maintains that anything is possible, and that by working together, everyone
  can start a homeschool and a cooperative. I met Samantha a few months ago when I
  moved to New York. I had the privilege of visiting the homeschool and meeting many
  of the incredible children and parents who make up the community. I hope that this
  video is widely shared and that Samantha''s story can inspire others to take on
  grassroots revolutionary change. Samantha has kindly offered to help anyone who
  would like to start a homeschool and hear more about their journey. Her email is:

  This is truly an example of grassroots, revolutionary change that the vegan community
  should celebrate!!! Thanks for watching and please share this amazing story :)'
