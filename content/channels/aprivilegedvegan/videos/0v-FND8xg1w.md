type: video
description: 'Today I am interviewing Yazan Al-Saadi, a Syrian Canadian writer and
  researcher, about the Syrian War. Yazan discusses a wide range of topics, from his
  views on US intervention and problems in the mainstream discourse about Syria, to
  Assad, imperialism, and lines of action that should be prioritized to help the Syrian
  people. He stresses that liberation and self- determination for the Syrian people
  should be at the center of the conversations about Syria. You can find more of Yazan’s
  work at Al-Akbar English, Muftah, Raseef 22, and Lebanon support. Or on YouTube!
