description: 'I''m so excited to welcome Lili and Raffi from Collectively Free on
  my channel! This interview might seem a bit long by Youtube standards, but I think
  it is worth every minute. Here are the time stamps of what we talk about if you
  want to jump around (though I don''t think it''s necessary ;)) I hope you enjoy
  it, and please remember to follow Collectively Free on: Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/user/collectivelyfree

  "Please introduce yourselves and Collectively Free! How did you meet? Were you already
  politicized when you met or did you start that journey together? Were you both already
  vegan?" 5:50 "Were you always pro-intersectional vegans? I wasn''t... " 10:50 "I
  want to ask you both about being lesbian women in the AR movement because I feel
  like there is very little representation of queer women (or any women really) in
  leadership positions. How do you confront and disrupt heteronormativity in the movement?"
  13:17 "How are queer liberation and animal liberation connected?"(Watch footage
  of a Collectively Free disruption!) 20:30 Watch footage of a Collectively Free disruption
  against police brutality! 23:10 "In the actions you organize, you use your bodies
  to disrupt public space. Often in this movement, women are told that the best way
  they can use their bodies in the streets is to “get undressed for the animals” and
  make veganism look sexy. Collectively Free provides a good example of an alternative
  way to use our (female) bodies as a means of resistance. Could you tell me a little
  bit about the actions you stage, why they are effective, and how they might differ
  from more traditional AR street demonstrations like the ones organized by PETA?
  " 28:10 Collectively Free does street theatre! Listen to Lili and Raffi discuss
  it, and watch footage! 30:53 More talk about PETA demonstrations 32:38 "What has
  the feedback been about Collectively Free in the vegan community? (both good and
  bad)" 36:16 "How do you combine art and activism?" Watch footage of Collectively
  Free ARTIVISM! 39:10 "How do you self care and how do you avoid burnout as an activist?"
  41:30 "Where can people find you?" THANK YOU TO RAFFI AND LILI!!! Other links: Song
