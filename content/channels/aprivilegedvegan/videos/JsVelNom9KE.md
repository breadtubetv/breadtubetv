description: 'Hey Everyone! This is the speech that I gave at Vegfest London (October
  2017). In this talk, I try to make sense of the fact that veganism is growing, and
  still, more animals are being killed. Here is a breakdown of the talk: 0:48 What
  does the news tell us? How can two opposing industries be profitable at the same
  time? 7:20 Three ways the meat industry uses to stay profitable even with a stagnating
  meat/ dairy consumption and a growing vegan market in industrialized nations 13:24
  How capitalism can use vegan consumerism as a way to survive and thrive 18:05 How
  has neoliberal citizenship changed us? 21:55 How is capitalist veganism limiting
  animal rights activists (personal story) 27:14 Final thoughts: using the “de-commodification
  of life” as a principle to ally all social justice movements Follow me on Facebook!
