type: video
description: 'In this video, I talk about what it means for veganism to go "mainstream"
  in a neoliberal capitalist system. I also talk about how vegan restaurants and supermarkets
  have been popping up mainly in gentrifying neighborhoods and how we should think
  critically about what this means. Links to other relevant videos FOOD DESERTS https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rL0N6-gqXM
