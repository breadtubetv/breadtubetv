  http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0141854 This scholarly
  study that looked at county-level shootings of civilians by police all across the
  U.S. found 1) That persons who are black and unarmed are about 3.5 times as likely
  to be shot by police as whites who are unarmed; 2) That blacks who are unarmed are
  just as likely to be shot by police as whites who are armed; 3) that in certain
  jurisdictions the ratio for the risk of an unarmed black person being shot compared
  to an unarmed white person being shot climbs as high as 20:1; and 4) that these
  ratios can not be explained by local crime rate differences in general or black
  crime rates in particular Emotional and Physical Safety In Protests: http://41.media.tumblr.com/05e497bb6f63b88e94991da0a8d2f20c/tumblr_nnp6pyWpBz1rqdn30o1_500.jpg
