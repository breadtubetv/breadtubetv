description: PhD graduate from Toronto. I studied Human Geography / Political Ecology,
  focusing on the intersections between political economy and global environmental
  governance. This sobering experience has led me to be the staunch anti-capitalist,
  vegan activist you see today! I make educational videos about political economy/capitalism,
  environmental issues, veganism, and issues relating to social/economic justice
