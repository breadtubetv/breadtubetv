      We're focused on making quality analysis mostly of anime with a leftist perspective. We particularly care about shonen, and feel like we have a FRESH!~ perspective. Star is the only member who hasn't watched the masterpiece that is Hunter x Hunter 2011, so I'll just leave a reminder for him here to do that.
