We've added a channel search feature to https://breadtube.tv!

Search is based on full or partial results from

- Name https://breadtube.tv/channels/#search:contra
- Description https://breadtube.tv/channels/#search:anarchist
- Tags https://breadtube.tv/channels/#search:news

Going forward there are a few things that it would be good to work on.

- Adding a bunch of tags [here's an example to kick off thoughts](https://github.com/breadtubetv/breadtubetv/blob/master/data/channels/left1ne.yml#L11-L16)
- We have a great collection of channels (please let us know what's missing!) but we're very light on videos.
- We have a pull request to show the videos per channels, I think it has small usability issues, this will really help us analyze what's missing.
- Now that the channel import scripts are working it's becoming easier to keep up with content suggestions, having that same script for adding videos would be really helpful as we add video content.
- It would be helpful to put together some more intelligent forms now, allowing people to suggest videos, tags, etc on each channel.

Some great conversations happening on [Github](https://github.com/breadtubetv/breadtubetv/issues) and in our [Discord](https://breadtube.tv/discord).

Feedback has been really helpful, thanks!
