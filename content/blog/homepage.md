Now that we've added so much content to BreadTube based on the fantastic
suggestions from the community, it's time to start showing off more dynamic
content on the homepage.

By reviewing the
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/breadtube/top/?t=month"><strong>r/BreadTube</strong></a>
community content we were able to identify
the top rated videos for the last month and show them on the homepage.

This content is easily updated and something we want to automate by having bots monitor
Reddit in order to update these periodically.
