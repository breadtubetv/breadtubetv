title: 'Marxist Theory 101 #4: The State (Bourgeois and Proletarian Dictatorship)'
description: |-
  -State is an instrument of class rule
  -Every state has a class character and a ruling class
  -In modern society this class can be the capitalists or the workers
  -When marxists refer to a proletarian dictatorship or a bourgeois dictatorship they mean a society controlled by one class

  -There is no general democracy where all classes can be equal

  -the proletarian dictatorship is a worker's democratic state where the majority (workers and their allies) rule over the remnants of the capitalist class and it's allies
