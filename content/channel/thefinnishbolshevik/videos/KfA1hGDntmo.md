title: 'Discussing Holodomor Again (RE: True Facts About The Holodomor)'
description: "Me and Zach (Morbid Gameplay) talk about the Holodomor for an hour and
  watch a video response to me by a user called \"Give Me Liberty Give Me Freedom\".\n\nAt
  first we were gonna respond to some arguments but it quickly became obvious there
  weren't any. The video was completely pointless and baseless so we just used as
  a loose context for our discussion.\n\nIf Give Me Liberty wants an actual point
  by point refutation of his arguments and claims then he should:\n\n1) Make specific
  claims, not contradictory bs that goes all over the place\n\n2) Back them up with
  actual source so that I could check them out. Don't link an entire website. If the
  site is your source then point to a specific section. \n\n3) Refute my points or
  debunk my evidence in my original video because it already largely disproves most
  of the shit in your video before hand. Your response just did not even show more
  then a couple of seconds of my video and deliberately neglected to even deal with
  it at all. Its hardly even a response.\n\nHis miserable video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0e25jzq40o"
