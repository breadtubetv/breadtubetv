title: The Worst Chomsky Video Ever?
description: "The Hammer and Sickle\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAOU2ZMxUTJYzOganZqgJkQ\n\nThe
  Voice of Communism\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83dNvood6ECne0DwqzBf6Q\n\nBlack
  Cat\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCM0GMDJL76cwUji2m6u3dkg\n\nChomsky has a truly
  unique position on Bolshevism & Marxism -- \na truly idiotic position that is! The
  mind boggles.\n\nHis argument is the complete opposite of the typical dogmatist
  \"orthodox marxist\" or Menshevik argument. While those people argue that the Bolsheviks
  were too pro-peasant and shouldn't have attempted socialism in a peasant country
  Chomsky says the opposite. In fact he says that the Bolsheviks were totally anti-peasant!
  \n\nChomsky goes even further then that and claims that Marx was a Narodnik. Keep
  in mind that Narodnik's were explicitly anti-Marxist."
