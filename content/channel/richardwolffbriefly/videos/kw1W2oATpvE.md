description:
  The U.S. Senate killed a new ban on financial companies requiring customers to give up their right to sue in order to open accounts. Banks, credit card issuers and other financial companies will be able to block customers from banding together to sue over disputes, after the U.S. Senate on Tuesday narrowly killed a rule banning the firms from using "forced arbitration" clauses.
