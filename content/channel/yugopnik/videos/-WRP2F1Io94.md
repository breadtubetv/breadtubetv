title: "Slavic Stereotypes and Minority representation in Western Media - An Eastern European Critique"
channel: yugopnik
description: "This topic is very close to my heart, as It's never really talked about. Even though I've considered myself a \"Citizen of the World\" the particular misrepresentation of my own culture has always cut deep. This though does not mean I endorse \"cultural representation\" in modern media as a simple profit source. In this critique I look at the intent behind creating diverse media - instead of diverse media itself."
