title: "Richard Wolff Schools Jordan Peterson on Marx, at #JPCON"
channel: thenewsymbolization
description: |-
  Jordan Peterson said that the reason he cancelled on the scheduled debate with Douglas Lain of Zero Books was because ZB isn't popular enough.
  <br/><br/>
  This does not explain why he went on the Rogan podcast weeks later to say Marxists won't debate him.
  <br/><br/>
  So we scheduled a popular Marxist economist to debate Peterson, or speak in lieue of a debate. Dr. Richard Wolff came /at cost/, whereas Peterson said he would not debate Wolff for less than $50,000... obviously we, a student club, don't have that kind of money, so Wolff ended up speaking to us on his own. Wolff gave a crash course on what every responsible citizen, Peterson included, should know about capitalism, as shown by one of its most insightful critics.
