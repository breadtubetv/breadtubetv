title: 2018-02-11 Starting to Learn Permaculture
description: "Quick checkin about what I learnt this weekend regarding permaculture.
  I go over the first 6 principles and quickly touch on energy descent. \n\nNot a
  lot here, but a good chance to jump in front of the camera and try a camera stand.
  Definitely need a microphone."
