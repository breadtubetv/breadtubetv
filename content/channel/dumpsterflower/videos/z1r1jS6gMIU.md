title: "Is Trans Inclusion a Threat to Cis People in Gendered Spaces?"
channel: dumpsterflower
description: "Trans people do not present a threat in gendered spaces. Also it has been brought to my attention i should have used the term assigned gender in some places where i have used birth gender. I am really sorry for any offence caused. The YouTube description box is too small so I have listed the core sources, scientific studies and data and links to trans and non binary channels here, but the full description with links to all sources is in a pinned comment below."
