description: "Before arranging a meeting with a Kremlin-connected Russian lawyer he
  believed would offer him compromising information about Hillary Clinton, Donald
  Trump Jr. was informed in an email that the material was part of a Russian government
  effort to aid his father’s candidacy, according to three people with knowledge of
  the email.\n\n \U0001F4A5BECOME A PATRON at http://patreon.com/petercoffin\n \n*****************************************\nYou've

  breaking news that Trump Jr. Was Told in Email of Russian Effort to Aid Campaign.
  Apparently, the Russian government was the subject of an email to Donald Trump Jr.
  This isn't necessarily hard, convictable evidence of Russia collusion, but it seems
  pretty clear some kind of Russian interference was ran. A Russia lawyer met with
  Don jr, and Trump jr was told in email about russia effort to aid campaign. Repeat:
  Trump jr was told in email of Russia effort to aid campaign. It's astounding Donald
  Trump jr would meet with a moscow lawyer with the heat that was already being applied
  on Donald Trump even at this point last summer. Trump jr was featured in the New
  York Times for meeting with this Russian lawyer, possibly talking about campaign
  help. Progressive and liberal activists might be suspicious, but it's important
  to understand a meeting where someone might give dirt on Hillary doesn't legally
  change the situation much unless there was reciprocal action promised on the part
  of a winning President Trump.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/daG7/\n\n-~-~~-~~~-~~-~-\nNEW
