  http://petercoff.in\n\n**************************\n\nLAST NIGHTLY takes on the Google
  manifesto. Yes, THAT Google manifesto. The one that is very bad about diversity
  and feminism. It's called \"Google's Ideological Echo Chamber. The Google memo doesn't
  understand that diversity is strength and instead attempts to blame the gender gap
  on women. The writer of the Google internal manifesto \"Googles ideological echo
  chamber\" was fired, but not until Google saw the narrative was beyond their control.
  Women in tech have to deal with gender inequality non-stop as it is, and this Google
  engineer's diversity manifesto is going to embolden those who agree with it to work
  against women in the workplace. The Google manifesto scandal makes sense as a loud
  topic, it's literally an anti-diversity manifesto scandal. The Google anti-diversity
  manifesto begat a full Google anti-diversity manifesto scandal, which is warranted.
  With an anti-diversity manifesto, of course women and other marginalized identities
  are at risk. The Google engineer publishes anti-feminist manifesto really shook
  a lot of people.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/daGY/\n\n-~-~~-~~~-~~-~-\nNEW
