title: Toyota "Wonderful World" DEATH RACE | ADVERSARIES⁴⁸
description: "★THIS WEEK: 2018 Toyota Camry: \"Wonder\" - SO, OFFICIALLY, \"As he
  rides through the hilly countryside with his family in the 2018 Toyota Camry, this
  young boy can't help but marvel at the vibrant greenery and airborne birds as they
  go flying past the windows. A minimalist, a cappella version of the song \"What
  a Wonderful World\" accompanies the car's circuitous route through windy mountain
  roads. When a family of deer crossing the road force an RV to make a sudden stop,
  a potentially dangerous situation arises as the Camry rapidly approaches the stalled
  camper.\" Actually, though, this shit is terrifying. \n\n ★It's not JUST a commercial!
