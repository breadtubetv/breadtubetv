  are wondering how things got out of hand so quickly. One group that didn't do enough
  to prevent the violence as the crowds grew and tensions flared: the police.  \U0001F4A5BECOME

  the right, the racist violence in charlottesville. There was a white nationalist
  charlottesville rally called #unitetheright where the alternative right, or the
  far right, or really just hate groups, had a hate march. It was pure white nationalism
  on display, with white nationalist celebs like richard spencer charlottesville.
  People thought he was arrested in the charottesville violence based on a photo he
  was seen in, but unfortunately no. The racism of the traditionalist worker party
  and other white supremacists like nazis was on display in charlottesville.\n\nHelp
