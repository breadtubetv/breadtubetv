  takes on a manipultive American Greetings Commercial entitled \"Not Alone.\" It's
  part of the #GiveMeaning campaign and one of many greeting card commercial attempts
  to pull your heartstrings. This American Greetings ad, and indeed the whole Give
  Meaning Campaign, or #GiveMeaning Campaign, positions AG for an American Greetings
  infertility campaign, which is kind of a weird form of American Greetings entertainment.
  American Greetings (organization) is really just using greeting cards, pregnancy,
  support, and friendship to sell \"thinking of you\" cards.\n\nHelp us caption &
