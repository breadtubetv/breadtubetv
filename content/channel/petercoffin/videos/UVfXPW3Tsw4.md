title: Election Pre-Post Mortem
channel: petercoffin
description: The 2016 Election is in a few days, and I think we've had enough Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump for a century. I don't want to do a post mortem because I think we've already been subjected to enough. Let's talk third parties a bit then dump Trump, okay?
