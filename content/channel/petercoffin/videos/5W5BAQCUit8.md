  http://petercoff.in\n\n************************************\n\nLAST NIGHTLY explores
  the comments of Tom Steyer, the largest individual donor for the Democratic party,
  about Bernie Sanders and working families. He says the DNC desperately needs to
  adopt Sanders' platform, and go beyond \"#navigatingtrumpsamerica\" stuff. Whether
  the Democratic National Committee actually starts to take on income inequality,
  the 2016 election democrats didn't go well and the Democrats need to prepare for
  the 2018 elections as well as the 2020 elections. We need single payer, even a billionaire
  hedgefund manager Tom Steyer is all about the fight for 15. He's probably not anti
  capitalism but he is pro Medicare for all. I think we should realize what Tom Steyer
  Trump statements make sense. Tom Steyer 2020 statements should be heeded. On healthcare
  and medicaid the statements made at the people's summit, or hell by Jeremy Corbyn,
  and realize that socialism is the answer. We need health care for all. This is for
  progressives, it's good progressive news and we will see more bernie sanders speech
  during the bernie sanders 2020 campaign.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/daG5/\n\n-~-~~-~~~-~~-~-\nNEW
