description: "The debate between Slavoj Žižek and Jordan Peterson was billed as the “debate of the century”, but many on the American far left were unimpressed by the prospect of it. This video explores what the outcome of the debate might have been, critiques the criticism of the debate, and provides an excerpt from Eliot Rosenstock’s book “Zizek in the Clinic“."
