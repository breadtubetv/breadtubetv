    description: "The Largest Online News Show in the World. Hosted by Cenk Uygur
      & Ana Kasparian. LIVE weekdays 6-8pm ET.

Young Turk (n), 1. Young progressive
      or insurgent member of an institution, movement, or political party. 2. Young
      person who rebels against authority or societal expectations. (American Heritage
      Dictionary)

The Young Turks were the first original talk show on Sirius satellite
      radio and the first live, daily webcast on the internet. But that is not the
      revolution.

We are a rare show that combines all of the news that people
      care about in one place. We are not afraid to talk about politics and entertainment
      and sports and pop culture. But that is not the revolution either.
