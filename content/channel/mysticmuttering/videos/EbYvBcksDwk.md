description: "In 1381, the English peasants rose against King Richard II, demanding
  an end to the poll tax, punishment of abusive nobles, abolition of serfdom, and
  some called for the end of the entire feudal system. They were brutally crushed,
  their leaders gruesomely executed, but their spirit never died.\n\nI wrote this
  ballad to the tune of the sea shanty “My Son John,” and it’s my hope that people
  pick it up to sing at protests, direct actions, and such. REMEMBER- the reactionaries
  of the world do NOT have a monopoly on tradition; modern radicals can find inspiration
  in any era. We forget our long-dead comrades at our peril.\n\nIf you want to help

  far\nHe’s left the fields and gone to war \nThe smith has taken his plowshare \nTo
  forge a shield boss and a spear \nSing a way down to London town\nhey for the rebels
  and a hey derry down \n\nThere was a time when we were free \nBut the nobles think
  we’re property\nThey send the dogs of their cruel tax \nWho grope our girls and
  break our backs \nSing a way down to London town \nhey for the rebels and a hey
  derry down \n\nWe put the taxmen all to flight \nWe sent out horsemen through the
  night\nIf you would be free, for once and all,\nRise up and heed Wat Tyler’s call!
  \nSing a way down to London town\nhey for the rebels and a hey derry down \n\nOur
  numbers swelled, we broke the Gaols\nThe nobles raged to no avail \nAnd ev’ry corner
  of the land \nIt echoed with our loud demand \nSing a way down to London town\nhey
  for the rebels and a hey derry down \n\nMass was led by good John Ball,\nA preacher
  loved by rebels all\n“When Adam delved and Eve span\nWho was then the gentleman”
  \nSing a way down to London town\nhey for the rebels and a hey derry down \n\nWith
  bold Jack Straw and Ploughman Piers \nWe entered London with no fears\nThe King
  hid in his tower strong \nWhile the streets did ring with blood and song \nSing
  a way down to London town\nhey for the rebels and a hey derry down\n\n\nThe King
  in terror did agree \nAll former serfs would now be free \nBut at Smithfield, we
  were betrayed \nThey laid Wat Tyler in his grave \nSing a way down to London town\nhey
  for the rebels and a hey derry down \n\nYe peasants all, ye rebels bold \nHeed well
  the story I have told \nYou have all the power that you need \nTo rid yourself of
  a tyrant’s greed \nSing a way down to London town \nhey for the rebels and a hey
  derry down"
