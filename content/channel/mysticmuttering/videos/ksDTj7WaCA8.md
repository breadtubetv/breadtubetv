title: Troll-A-Bye
description: "Have some lyrics! \n\n\nWhen a hush quiets Facebook and Twitter\nAs
  the stars begin to appear\nThey're nodding off all over Reddit\nAnd snoring from
  4chan I hear\n\nSo I get my guitar and my webcam\nAnd tuck in the sleepy blogrolls
  \nAnd then I tune up and quite softly\nI sing to the Internet trolls\n\nLullabye
  and goodnight \nCount your .gif sheep\nYou can troll in the morning \nBut for now
  get some sleep\nDream of lulz, dream of /b \nAnd how to form babby\nDream of lulz,
  dream of /b\nAll your base are belong to me\n\nAnd once all the trolls are a-snoozing\nand
  the tubes are all safe for a while \nAll the folks that they were abusing\nSing
  out in an old fashioned style!\n\nOn the YouTube, the mighty YouTube,\nThe trollers
  sleep tonight\nOn the YouTube, the quiet YouTube, \nThe trollers sleep tonight \n\n
  . ... \n\n\n\n*yawns* G'night everybody! \n\nTru3bad0ur's webcam video January  1,
