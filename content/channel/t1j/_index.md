      Hi, I'm T1J. (Also known as "the1janitor")
      This channel is mostly video essays about things that interest me, usually from a progressive socdem point of view. I also livestream weekly. Sometimes I do other stuff too tho.

      Although my videos are never intentionally offensive or shocking; and I try very carefully to be sensitive, I often discuss controversial and potentially triggering topics. So my channel should not be consider safe for people who have triggers of any sort. I've chosen not to provide specific content warnings on each individual video. Consider this a content warning for the entire channel.

      Say hi to me! hello@the1janitor.com
