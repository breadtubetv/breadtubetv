Independent
      political commentary, media criticism, news and entertainment, with petty attempts
      at comedy; hosted by David Doel.

Fed up with the misinformation spread through
      mainstream corporate media, David Doel comes from a background working in broadcast
      news, and ran for political office as a Green Party politician in 2015. Through
      The Rational National he aims to expose this misinformation while also lending
      his commentary on politics, news, and entertainment.
