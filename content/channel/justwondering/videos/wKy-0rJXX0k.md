title: "What's cybersurveillance got to do with you?"
channel: justwondering
description: "So much of our lives are online, and yet we understand so little about what this means. In this video, we’re just wondering, how are our identities handled in cyberspace? How can we newly conceptualize privacy, who owns our data, and how much control do we have over what we share with friends and strangers? Big data is getting bigger by the second, and we might need to decide what we want to do with it as a society. Before something or someone else makes the choice for us."
