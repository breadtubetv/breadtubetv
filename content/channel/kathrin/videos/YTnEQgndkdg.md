title: 'Voluntourism: doing more harm than good?'
description: |
  I discuss the neocolonial and neoliberal elements of voluntourism. How it promotes
  the white saviour complex, poverty aesthetics, cultural cannibalism, promotes the
  demonstration effect, cultural insensitivity, white manâ€™s burden and uneven development.
  It can also enhance a lack of long term planning and can increase unemployment and
  dependency on the west.
